I can understand if an individual who didn't have a happy childhood or didn't have a close and healthy relationship with their parents, especially with their fathers can have this unsettling view of this guy.

 That being said, I don't think this man deserves that kind of attitude or treatment. He's performing a kindness so rare to be honest my own brain had trouble registering and I find that sad. The video even says it, these kids aren't adopted because no one wants to deal with death; to care, nurture, and love a sweet little soul knowing they're going to die is not something a lot of people want to deal with but he's doing it because someone has to care for them. They deserve a warm homemade meal, kisses when they're sad, to laugh and to be tucked in nicely in a soft and warm bed. Even if they're going to live for one more month, and I find it more upsetting that people condemn him instead of realizing how many foster kids have probably died without knowing that love. It's bad enough healthy foster kids  have a low probability of adoption, these sick kids have an even lower chance.
I get it, people have glimpsed evil but I like to believe people are innocent until proven guilty. Personally I don't believe he is a sick man to want to hurt these kids; you don't want attention on you when you want to hurt someone, you want to remain hidden and anonymous and he's fostered 40 kids and buried 10, that leaves 30 children and probably a handful would say something if he did abuse them.",0.0,Facebook/YouTube,anatomy_online_hate,2

"Getting citizenship is not as easy as many of you think. Couple that with the fact that many immigrants are doing jobs that many Americans won't do, for less than what we'd demand, and aren't covered by FMLA, able to get private insurance, and their employers do not have to meet ANY of the requirements of fair pay, work hours, safe working conditions. All of which are benefits we as citizens have. Yet they're willing to work 12 hours a day in fields, construction, meat processing facilities, housekeeping, while making $2.00/hr with no benefits or coverage under labor law requirements. 
When I see US citizens willing to work for the same pay under the same conditions, I'll believe that we as a country are willing to let these people go back. Because without them, your produce, meat, building costs, lawn/childcare are going to go up exponentially due to employers having to pay fairly and adhere to federally mandated rules. 
So don't complain when your lettuce is $2.99, lawncare is $250/month, and childcare is over $300/week.

"Cop here: I also was suspicious of the 2%-10% claim. I’ve investigated dozens of sexual assault allegations and I can remember a handful that were true.  I have absolutely had some true ones and it’s hard to explain, but I can usually tell pretty quickly when those are because the woman acts differently (and not how you’d expect). More so than how they act (I’ve had some [real] sexual assault victims act very quiet, or very sad, or very mad) but mainly their stories make sense.  The false ones that I’ve investigated just don’t make sense and it’s blatantly obvious. The timelines don’t make sense, big plot points change, suspect description changes, or the suspect has definitive proof of the lie.  I’ve commented on a case of mine before where when I talked to the suspect he showed me texts from the night in question from the “victim” saying no one could find out about them hooking up or her boyfriend would hear.  Well the boyfriend heard and when I showed her the texts (from her to “suspect”) she just apologized and got up to leave the room (like that was going to be the end of it). Taking her to jail was very satisfying.   Cops still should have due diligence to investigate all claims like they are true. I have sisters, a mother, and a wife and if some cop blew off a real assault I’d be furious. But IF the report is proven false, that person needs to go to jail.

Police has the legitimate mandate to detain people who (actively) interfere with an investigation and/or obstruct that investigation. Does the police need to be as forceful? No.  > It's not a crime to have alcohol in a cooler when none of it is open.  I am not familiar with laws in the US, nor am I a lawyer. But as a reference, in the Netherlands we have something that's called een ""Algemene Plaatselijke Verordening"" or APV. It translates roughly to ""General Local Regulation"". An APV is used to impose additional restrictions on a smaller area, such as not possessing any stimulating materials and/or alcohol within an area of the city. Should such an APV be applied to the beach, it becomes legally enforceable and you can be fined or arrested. I used to work in a football (soccer) stadium as security, and the entire area around the stadium was under an APV that made the possession of alcohol illegal during the days that there were football events within the complex. As a result, anyone who was found with alcohol either in their hand or carrying it, can receive a hefty fine and be denied access to the stadium.  Why is this important? I am sure US law has something akin to that, though I am not clear on the name used. If such a regulation is put into place, ownership of alcohol even if closed and in the cooler would be illegal. Furthermore, by having that alcohol on the beach there is a very high probability that one or more of those alcoholic drinks will be consumed (which would possibly be illegal depending on local rules). No one will bring a cooler with 6 beer in it, and leave it out in the sun to not drink any of them.  > Tackles her, rubs her face in the sand, then starts punching her repeatedly while on top of her?

If he wasn't a violent, power hungry shithead, the police officers and the girl simply could have waited for the Aunt that she had called to return to the beach, she could have claimed the unopened alcohol in question and absolutely zero charges would have been brought.  It is incredibly difficult for a police officer to prove ""possession"" of an unopened alcohol container when there was allegedly an adult present moments ago, and when both girls were stone sober.   Obstruction is something American cops use to force compliance or add additional charges to someone who isn't ""cooperating.""   Police, specifically NJ police, are notorious for using tactics like that to force compliance, to manipulate people into admitting guilt, to get more information. I have dealt with NJ police literally my entire life. I was born and raised in NJ.  Your alcohol laws are simply different from those in New Jersey.

Just do not confuse legality of actions with the interpretation of people on how to proceed. **Detaining the lady was an appropriate action, the method in doing so was not.**  Based on the allegations (possession of alcohol by a minor), the officer had all the rights to detain her while conducting further investigation. Should that aunt come by and verify the story independently then the lady would be released with an apology for the trouble. At least, that would assume that the cops themselves are upstanding people. I do not know them, so I can not judge.  The fact that she was in possession of alcohol, even if she held it for someone else, is already a problem legally. Under New Jersey statute N.J.S.A. 2C:33-15 it is illegal for a minor to possess or consume alcohol. Any person not of legal drinking age (21 years old) who is caught purchasing alcohol or **is in possession of alcohol in a public place** can be charged with the disorderly person's offense of Under Age Alcohol Possession.  It doesn't matter if it belonged to her aunt or not, she was in possession of the alcohol at that moment and therefore in violation of the above law. That these laws are draconic is a very different issue than the one posted here. The lady refused to cooperate with the police, which works against her argument that it is her aunt's alcohol. Why is it so difficult to be polite and cooperate with the police rather than screeching and yelling while obstructing their investigation.  Did the police officers do everything right? Absolutely not. But the procedure applied and the actions committed by the police officers do not absolve this girl from breaking the law on underage possession of alcohol. It does not absolve her from obstructing an investigation by refusing to cooperate with basic questions, especially when she's trying to play the ""OH MY AUNT OWNS THESE"" card.

The slam to the floor was absolutely excessive, which is illegal in any jurisdiction. Also, in any jurisdiction, a cop must witness you commit a crime, or have reasonable suspicion that you have committed a crime.

"							hell i think the problem now is that people forget you have to reconstruct the deconstruction.  like from what i understand deconstructions push tropes and trends to their logical conclusions to show the flaws and thus show a new take and proper criticism of a cliche.  you then have to fix those flaws and basically make the trope cool and sensical again.   i think it's one reason the MCU is a billion dollar franchise now outside of just being well crafted entertianment.  they actually embrace the weird and wonderful kitchen sink kitchen which is superhero comics that have both magic and superscience, gods and aliens extra-dimensional entities and ancient races all coexisting in a somewhat coherent framework.  if the original X-men films and the Nolan Batman trilogy made superheroes serious and grounded the MCU made them fun and fantastic :D  an example is how they reconstructed the deconstruction of colorful costumes where all movie supers had boring black leather for ""practicality"".  Captain America got his star spangled suit because after being given the serum he got hired as a mascot for the war effort complete with bright and goofy 1940's spandex.  and only after he proved himself saving a bunch of soldiers from a hydra prison right after a gig and improvising a better combat suit using props from the show did he come to be respected and therefore make star-spangled spandex look good.  and iron-Man is his classic flashy red and yellow because Tony Stark is a flashy egotist who loves fanciness as well as fuctionality and treated his combat suit as a hot rod. we saw him build the suit with ease due to his genious and thus earned our respect to trust his design choices and dude has wicked sense of style :D  and i wanna say the Guardians of the Galaxy reconstructed  the classic comic book trope of aliens being a suspiciously similar substitute to human culture by having common cultural trappings like toys and t-shirts present with an alien style.  like Star Lord had a grey Tee that had some sort of slogan written in an alien script and Yandu had various little funko type figurines on his dashboard which looked like stylized versions of alien animals.  like i spotted a Dunny fig with 3 limbs and 3 ears and a Littlest Pet Shop cat with one eye.  so since those little details shown space people can develop similar cultural trends to earth people it made the more pulpy stuff like Maori flavored Gladiator games in Thor Ragnarok all the more acceptable.  guess more SJW showrunners are too busy showing how racist and sexist everything is they forgot how to make it not that anymore but actual good and interesting XD",0.0,Gab + Reddit,benchmark,3

"				I, for one, will be forever suspicious of the so-called ""Age of Man"" when its proponents through the series form orders that are unabashedly built on greed, deceit, and murder, but I'll at least admit that the stories are purposefully made ambiguous as to let players come up with their own conclusions to what's going on and what factions, if any, are in the right.  But that's not to say that I believe Dark Souls is hopeless.  In fact, I'd say that there's something intrinsically hopeful about the series (and the titles) purely from the basic gameplay: players overcoming trials and hardships, vanquishing mighty foes encountered along the way.  As for the story, I'd point to the End of Fire ending of DS3, which I'd call the best closure to the series as a whole, being built on the Fire Keeper's hope that mercy-killing the artificially-prolonged world altogether will eventually give birth to a wholly new one.  It's just foolish to call Dark Souls hopeful by pointing to the Age of Dark, its nature being one of the series' most contentious story elements.  Bloodborne is a little more pessimistic in that none of the endings put a stop to the turmoil caused by warring Great Ones and their aspiring human servants, but at least the Yharnam Sunrise ending has you personally escaping from it.  > So to sum it up.

The factual statistics also suggest that a very large percentage of Muslims are socially and theologically conservative, and would favor laws that restrict our civil liberties in the name of their religion. A survey of British Muslims found that a *supermajority* thought homosexuality should be criminalized.  Sure, they aren't necessarily *jihadists*. But if you believe in forcing society to live by Islamic norms *even via the ballot box* then you're an Islamist (""Jihadists"" are Islamists who support terrorism as a means to forcing society to live by Islamic norms).   Yes, there are many Muslims whom are not Islamists. But we need to take the problem seriously.

I am sure you know full well that this is entirely subjective. Outlets like HuffPo and Guardian are generally considered ""left-leaning MSM"" but among right wing/alt-right circles they are often referred to as ""far left"" or even ""extremist"".  As an example of how this also occurs on the right, Milo Yiannopolis works well - Milo is often at great pains to point out that he considers his views to be conservative-centrist, and in no way extreme. There are plenty on the left though, who considers some of the key beliefs he espouses - such as Muslims not being welcome in the West, and feminism being a dangerous ideology - as ""far right"".   Personally I think a good indicator of whether an opinion/belief is extreme or moderate, is whether it involves imposing your will on other people.  Hence ""Abortion should be illegal"" = extreme While ""Everyone should have the choice whether or not to engage in abortion"" = moderate.   That's a big part of the reason why I consider myself a liberal/progressive, rather than a conservative. To me, the liberal/progressive option is more often than not the one which involves giving people a choice, while the conservative/reactionary position is one which involves removing choice.

He's not going to speak in an highly precise, polished, educated manner on the subject and it reeks of classism to basically demand he do so. Yes, he knows not all Muslims are Islamists, he knows the distinction and has affirmed it at multiple times.   You say he's using ""weasel words"" but if you want to condemn activists for not using sufficiently qualified, nuanced language, Tommy Robinson is a relatively mild offender.   It isn't wrong to say that Islam, if by ""Islam"" we're speaking in terms of popularly and widely embraced interpretations and understandings thereof, does indeed contain tenets which don't precisely fit in nicely with modern western cosmopolitan pluralistic liberal democracy.   When we were critiquing the religious right, we made *absolutely no bones* about citing ""clobber verses"" from their holy texts and pointing out that these stood in the way of them embracing a tolerant interpretation of their religion. We also very rarely brought out huge levels of theological nuance, we rarely took great pains to distinguish between denominations, and we didn't get called bigots for doing so (except by the religious right themselves, whom are not taken seriously).  Why, pray tell, is the *same treatment* some unfathomable bigotry?  Yes, I know about the Mu'tazilites, and I know there are the Ibadis and the Ahmadis blah blah blah, but you can't *bitch about linguistics* as a way to get around the fact that in today's world, *an extremely large proportion of Muslims are Salafist or Deobandist*. Are you going to bitch about Tommy not being able to cite Averroes' views on the number of angels that could stand on a pinhead? Or are you going to actually confront the meat of the criticism?   >I am sure you know full well that this is entirely subjective. Outlets like HuffPo and Guardian are generally considered ""left-leaning MSM"" but among right wing/alt-right circles they are often referred to as ""far left"" or even ""extremist"".  Yes, what counts as ""moderate"" and what counts as ""extreme"" can be subjective. No surprises there.  >Personally I think a good indicator of whether an opinion/belief is extreme or moderate, is whether it involves imposing your will on other people. Hence ""Abortion should be illegal"" = extreme While ""Everyone should have the choice whether or not to engage in abortion"" = moderate.  Well then by that definition I'm perfectly moderate, since I'm a libertarian. Although some would call my ideology, which is defined by a refusal to impose my will upon others, ""extreme.""  >That's a big part of the reason why I consider myself a liberal/progressive, rather than a conservative. To me, the liberal/progressive option is more often than not the one which involves giving people a choice, while the conservative/reactionary position is one which involves removing choice. (Gun control being the notable exception, I suppose).  School choice is another. And the fact that a huge slice of the 'progressive' left thinks that free speech is a cis het white male conspiracy to oppress others. The liberal tradition cares about individual choice... the Progressive tradition, which is rooted ultimately in the works of the totalitarian Auguste Comte, is not in favor of individual choice.

"		I thought it was decent when it came out, but Waid is overrated.   A big tell in a flawed story is if your introduce a key conflict--it may not  be the main conflict, it may only be the second or third conflict--but if it's a key conflict to the story, and it's resolved by some lazy deus ex machina (in this instance, dei ex machina embodied in Shazam), that resolves a critical conflict...the story is flawed.     One of the big conceits of the book was that there was this prophecy about the bat and the eagle in conflict.   through three issues it was implied it was Bats v Supes, then SHAZAM PLOT TWIST, it's Bats v Wonder Woman, and in issue four they're duking it out and SHAZAM! instead of resolving the intractable conflict between side A and side B...humans decide to nuke super humans (thus ending the conflict between Bats and WW...which was a freaking prophecy and treated as critical to the story up to that point) and Supes and a brainwashed Shazam have to stop the bomb (and half fail in doing so).   Ok.  You ended the Bats v WW conflict with a distraction.  It's a freaking Elseworlds story.  You are given the license to have consequences.   Let key characters die.   Let one side win.  Have cajones.   Re.  Solve.  The.  Con.  Flict.    Waid is tame.  His personal antics have more drama and consequences than his fiction.  Dude could never create anything new, write some science fiction novel, build a universe.  He's a fanboy that was competent in managing the month to month tension of comic book writing, but good at nothing else.  Neil Gaiman could invent and write outside of comics.  Joe Hill.  Even Kevin Smith, who started in film then went to comics in back.  That's impressive.    But these fanboy writers are just dull hacks (Waid, Busiek).  I don't need grim and gritty or anti-grim and gritty or any theme or motif, just invention and creativity.   I never, ever understood why those fanboy writers were put on a pedestal in the mid to late 90s.  Tame writers.  They're the same quality as Roy Thomas, with the exception that Roy a) actually created new borderline A lister characters (Vision) and quality B listers (Black Knight) (Waid and Busiek have done neither), B) Thomas was responsible for much of the Marvel Universe webbing, creating connections across character families that created the networked feel of the Marvel U in the 70s  (see what he did with Asgard and the Eternals and Ragnarok...pretty ingenious for comic writing) and carried in the 80s (that even Lee and Kirby (the creators) failed to do), and C) isn't worshipped as a god like Waid and Busiek are.    I'm listening to Scriver's broadcast yesterday on Waid and DinC, and yikes....I'm torn between wanting these stories about Waid to be true and not be true, because if they are true, man, what a despicable human being (him and Dan Slott) and if not true, then that type of trolling accusations just degrade society further (in our anonymous cyber/accusation oriented culture, I don't know what to believe is true when people speak roughly anonymously about others...makes me a skeptic).

That's never going to get us to a good place.     > Take the wage gap for instance.    I don't believe it's a issue in Sweden. It's frankly, not even real if you're doing a multi-varied analysis of the proposed issue. Women tend to pick lower paid jobs, and that's despite boys being prohibited from taking internships in fields outside of healthcare, and girls being forced to take internships at engineering fields. That's the sort of anti-individualistic fascism and social constructive ideas I don't want in a free country. And ashamed of what feminism did to this country. And the fact that every counter-argument whenever feminism is under criticism is ""you don't understand the issue"" in public forums here, is fucking damning.    > But it does highlight some conservative values that still linger that that limits peoples choices through norms if not by rules.  Yes, but to pretend conservative values only apply to gender differences is benign at best, idiotic at worst. The same conservative values is also why we respect religion despite it being a bunch of nonsense and why it's illegal to smoke weed, while 20 nicotine cigarettes and a bottle of vodka a day is acceptable as long as you come sober to work.    I'm not saying there aren't bad conservatives values, but I'm saying that there's a lot of complex issues we have to fight, and I believe fighting them as a libertarian for freedom, is way better, than fighting gender questions separately by using the governments to point sticks.   > Cause why do we have such a gap?   Why do people choose different jobs? I do know, that there's way bigger gaps between rich and poor people, than there are between poor women, and poor men, as well as rich women and rich men. (talking about earnings here, specifically).   But overall, I think it's a complex issue, and I've never heard any feminist ever state they need to think about it and do a proper analysis and reach a conclusion, the Swedish feminist, left, environmental and socialdemocratic party is convinced that there exists a systematic problem, which they can solve if given enough power. That's not fighting for equality, that's pretending communism works and ignoring the dangers of trying to change the world.     > We put a lot of expectations on women, but being able to earn a lot is not what we expect   Since when is expectations bad? And who are we? I don't like being spoken for, and I'd say men in general need to be held under higher expectations, not that women should be feeling less expectations. But overall, I'd say, it's a liberal issue, everyone should be held at the expectations that they can reasonable be able to manage, as individuals.    > Right wingers dont want women to have access to abortions or for kids to get sexual education(which makes the girls end up pregnant)   Wrong, you're asserting American-centric politics here. Right-wings and left-wingers doesn't mean the same thing to us. Here in Sweden, even the Swedish Democratic Party (the nationalists) who want to ban all immigrants and throw them out, are pro-abortion. Literally 95% of Sweden is pro-abortion, it's **never** been a question here about yes or no. It's been ""how late?"" from the very start, we're a extremely non-religious country, even our ""Christian democratic party"" isn't anti-abortion.    See how different cultures can be even in the west? I assume you didn't know that, which is fine, Sweden is a very small country, but I think it's dangerous to look at conservative views and assume they're dangerous or good, because they're different from where you're standing. We have conservative views in Sweden I question heavily which nobody can defend, simply because we don't even talk about conservative values, we just stay quiet about subjects that falls under that term. Drug use for example. It's just not discussed anywhere. And whenever it is discussed, it's whataboutism, in it's worst way. But you can't claim right-wingers want a certain thing because that's just not true in the west.    The only ones who are fighting for things like anti-abortion laws are Islamists. And it's lefties politicians who let those into our political system. I'm not against immigration, but I am heavily against segregation that leads to poor integration into society. We have huge subgroups in Sweden who never learn Swedish, we have people following religious conservative values and practices which are illegal here, and our socialist government isn't doing anything because of how afraid everyone is to be branded as a bigot or racist for calling out shitty ideas and behavior.    edit: I'd love to keep the discussion going, but I'm heading home for work now, have a great day!

Watch Louis Le Vau's video on this.  Well - listen to it since it's more of a ramble:  LINK  The conservative argument against loli is always the Miller case, but there are counterpoints for that argument - it is a big legal gray area in the US (where gab is located), which is why it's still a tough position to defend either way - on principle your default position is that you HAVE to defend it even if it's a grey area, because otherwise you are not being principled in your approach.  Free speech is a zero sum game - it's easy to defend what you agree with, but it's hard to defend what you find despicable.  Loli hits that moral spot for a lot of people who aren't familiar with otaku culture.  Right now a lot of the ""pro free speech"" sentiment aren't just coming from us middle of the road leftist/centrist types, but from a lot of traditional conservative evangelical types.  Compared to the left, conservatives are VERY sensitive about any depiction of children being harmed whereas the regressive left cares more about WAMEN and minorities being harmed.  So the depiction of loli in anime really bugs a lot of normie types, especially the normie conservative folks who are completely unaware of anime or the meme culture that is centered around it.  Unfortunately, KiA *has* to follow Reddit's authoritarian rules to exist.

"							Deep waters. I don't like where our country's headed in this aspect although I love every single thing Trump has done, so far as that goes. But there's more to this picture than Trump.  It's clear that antifa is controlled by the opposition -- this phenomenon just *shows up* in our streets, out of the blue via import from Europe and parts east? Riiiight. I'm sure THAT happened organically. Fuck sake.  OTOH, by arresting and prosecuting the (American, collegiate, usually white) street-level thugs of the Black Bloc, we can enact a bit of a ""broken windows"" policy against these scumbags before they succeed in spreading their message. It occurs to me that the target of an antifa attack is almost *never* the real target. The real target is the rest of the country. They're slowly teaching us: *don't fucking speak out or we'll come after you and your family* and it's not just the Tuckers of the world who get targeted. Tucker has resources and support. But when *I* get targeted, or you do, what do we do? Batten down the hatches, okay. But if their actions successfully cause us to retreat, contract, and avoid, while THEY expand, attack, and go on the offensive, they'll run the table with us. That can't be allowed to happen.

"So just to be clear:   About 10 million men and teenaged boys died fighting in WW1.    The majority of these men didn't have the right to vote, because suffrage in Europe was contingent on property ownership, and most working class men didn't own enough property to be enfranchised.    The mountains upon mountains of straight white male corpses propelled the universal suffrage movement to the forefront.    Women achieved the vote upon mountains of dead males, both in Europe and the US (see: civil war).   Not a single woman had to actually fight for suffrage.  She suffered no real risk.  She just had to complain to the men in power.   And the ""patriarchs"" in government gave women the vote with no conscription obligations (that's not equality, that's chivalry) as soon as the majority said they wanted it.    These men and boys, who suffered some of the worst deaths humanly imaginable -- having their guts blown out in trenches and inhaling poison gas, being eaten alive by rats while crucified on barbed wire -- were ""privileged"", according to feminists.     A sizable percentage of feminists from the time period actually encouraged men and boys -- who again couldn't vote -- to go die for them in the trenches, to protect female ""honor"" (see white feather campaign).    While the suffragists demanded universal suffrage, the suffragettes wanted only rich white women and men to vote.   We celebrate the latter, not the former, because the former draw into question feminist mythology  [Edit: there were some women from the time period, often described as feminists or proto-feminists, who were consistent; eg the American anarchist Emma Goldman (whom I'm quite sure would be appalled by modern feminism) helped mount a legal challenge arguing that conscription was a violation of the 13th Amendment's prohibition against involuntary servitude.   The Supreme Court disagreed.   Ironically Goldman considered the suffragettes a bunch of spoiled brats, and famously claimed that ""if voting changed anything they'd make it illegal""]    Hundreds if not thousands of men were executed on the front lines to prevent desertion, even though historians now agree that many WWI campaigns were useless suicide missions, that the men knew it, and that the ""deserters"" were in the right not to throw their lives away for a patch of mud.    In the US, men were imprisoned, tortured and even executed for refusing to fight.   These included conscientious objectors from religious groups.   (two of these men, Hutterite brothers, were tortured to death at Alcatraz).    The majority of American men who fought in WWI were effectively forced to do so.   Far more Americans who fought in WWI were conscripted than volunteered.    Today, little rich girls who would be living in the gutter without the benefaction of their rich daddies, and living in caves without the benefaction of men as a group, condemn powerless white men and boys from a hundred years ago who died being eaten alive by rats while crying out for their mothers -- because they were white, and male.     Yes, this is a perfectly sane society, and feminism is a perfectly sane philosophy.   Moreover it encourages ""gender equality.""    Honestly, I don't feel hate.  I just feel shame and disgust.   Shame for what feminism has done to this society, and disgust for both the men and women who have allowed this to happen.    ",0.0,Gab + Reddit,benchmark,3

"This could be a little incoherent because I don't sleep much these days  I say that gatekeeping is good and proper. People build a little community the way they like it, and would prefer to keep it that way. It makes sense and is natural. Why would they want someone(s), who were not involved in the building, to come along and take advantage of what was created and then change how it is to suit the newcomer's taste? Which is essentially what's happened with any nerd fandom you were made fun of for in high school but now everyone wears the t-shirt because it's en vogue  To use your example of ""doesn't want smelly girls in their boys-only pillow fort"", how many of you, when you were kids, were forced to include someone you don't really like/know into your game, and they go about changing it or members of the group do so the newcomer understands? I remember we were basically doing DnD LARPing when we were 10 or so and a kid the principal forced us to let him play with us didn't really get it. But he did watch the Kevin Sorbo Hercules show so he just wanted to be Hercules and beat shit up. Or a girl who turns your super hero fights into playing house  But the more important question, I think, is how hard it is to get past the gatekeeper. In my experience, it's usually really easy to disarm people by asking genuine questions to show interest, and people generally like to feel like their opinions or knowledge are worth sharing. If you ask enough questions, and play some games to put the answers to those questions into play, suddenly you are a genuine member of the fandom, or you lose interest and leave, instead of being someone screaming at the gates to be let in come hell or high water, BAMN  That being said, gatekeepers should remain at the gates, and not wander around trying to test everyone. Speak only when spoken to about the topic and all that. And there are always more zealous gatekeepers; you'll always find someone who has absurdly high standards before accepting you as a true member of the fandom. The important thing is that not everyone is like that. It's always annoying how quick people are to deny having traits attributed to a large group of people, yet are just as quick to assume everyone part of a group of people are all the same. I am sick unto death of all these ""x fandom is the most toxic fanbase ever"" type discussions  Unfortunately, the more people that get added to a group, the more things get watered down.

"			the fact that you simply hide behind some manipulated data without offering anything of substance is quite telling. you either have an agenda or are willingly ignorant.   your statement is false on the surface which tells me that you have never really argued your point at all. it is illegal to pay men and women differently. Their wages are the same. Their EARNINGS are not. they are not conflatable you fucking moron. They mean two completely different things.   Earnings constitutes variable such as longer hrs, overtime, bonuses, awards, etc.   men work more than women. men choose higher paying careers. women gravitate to jobs that dont pay shit.   when all the human variables such as free will and choice are accounted for, the gap DISSAPEARS. in other words, youre perpetuating a highly unusable, worthless peice of data so you can push an anti woman narrative.     at least answer me this if you dont address anything ive said:   if women got paid less than men, why arent men out of their jobs, being replaced by women? why are men hired at all? its simple business, you pay only as much as worth, and by your bullshit claim, women are only worth 75 percent of men. thats a lot of money these businesses could be saving. answer me that retard.

The total price of the hot tub and accessories was $14,489.10. Smith-Frawner also took out a loan for the remaining balance from the Oklahoma Educator's Credit Union, then a month later, $4,682.39 was taken out of the victim's account to pay off a loan at the Oklahoma Educator's Credit Union.  >Then, in October 2017, $295,000 was transferred from the victim's bank account to her personal account, one the victim did not have access to.  >Investigators say the total equaled over $450,000.

"Our punitive system is kinda dumb. When an organization breaks a rule in order to cut costs, the fine needs to be whatever it costs to clean up the mess, then whatever money they saved by doing things wrong, multiplied by the inverse of the odds of getting caught.   Example: wrong disposal of hazardous waste:   cost of doing it properly :$100k.  Cost to clean it up: $400k Odds of getting caught: 1 in 50  Total fine: $400k + 50 * $100k  Or perhaps since there are presumably 49 other improper disposals to clean where the propagator want caught, that fee should be multiplied too, becoming 50 * ($400k + $100k)  The point is that getting caught breaking the law needs to be MUCH more expensive than following the law and also much more expensive than what you're costing the victim.   So if I falsely accuse you of a crime that you would get 10 years for, my false accusation penalty should be at least 5x that, so 50 years minimum.   If a company sells customer data illegally, we need to calculate the damage it did to the customers, then add to that how much they got paid to do it or how much they made from the same in other ways, then multiply that by the inverse of the odds they would get caught (thus the more they tried to cover it up, the less likely it would be to get discovered, thus the higher the penalty multiplier). Once we have those numbers, fining the company that amount would actually be a significant deterrent.   If false rape aviation was punished by a year and only caught 10% of the time, on average a false accuser could expect to spend 36 days in jail. Bump that number up to where it ought to be assuming: 10% catch and conviction rate on false accusers, and 15 years for the original rape, gives: 15 years * 10 = 150 years.

"		Success from my point of view. Is an individual is born on planet earth. From infancy through their inevitable placement in the ground.   The individual exists relatively free from violent force imposed upon them. As well as a sense that at the end of ones life. Particular realistic milestones are reached. Upon which the individual can rest in peace.   Certain observable markers for men. Are proficiency within a particular field of passion. Construction, agriculture, livestock raising, manufacture of goods. Ranging from the bronze blade, up through the international space station.   Another marker, is when proficiency is achieved. The individual man desires to teach another person similar mastery. The only way to make more people is through the body of woman. Also around the time of basic proficiency. A man's sex drive is in full effect. He desires sex and commonly to make children whom he can teach throughout his life.   This is a very common desire. Society does not force the above paragraph upon the individual man.   Though some men do not consider the above a successful life. Some men enjoy solitude. Some men don't particularly desire to head a family unit. That is a best case.  Some men from multiple historical accounts. View a successful life as being capable of murdering as many people as possible. Then looting the possessions from the man or group of men they've murdered.   Therefore men who who want to master proficiency in a peaceful endeavour in regards to other men. Will lump men who define success as being solitary and introspective. With men who define success as murdering and pillaging as many as possible.    Women in general, define a successful life as one. In which they produce many new people. As well as being generally in good standing with the normal culture. Thereby ensuring someone will care for her for her entire existence here.   Women also have suspicion cast upon them. For example when a woman defines a successful life. As one in which she acquires as many status trinkets as possible. Through granting access to her vagina.   Yet the solitary woman is viewed as a witch. I think it's because women aren't naturally solitary individuals. Solitary women on average also display more antisocial behavior.

"				Why do you keep trying to make it about race? I've said both times that doesn't matter. And if you ignore context, I totally agree with you. If it was in the middle of the day, nobody would think twice about someone hanging out in the parking lot. Notice how I've consistently pointed out it's suspicious that they're hanging out by the cars at night. I've lived in apartment complexes like that and I've had my car broke into twice, both at night. So let me try to make this as simple as possible for you. If they were out in broad daylight it wouldn't be suspicious, if they were by their porch or maybe a common area like a gazebo it wouldn't be suspicious. What makes it suspicious is that it's clearly dark out and they're hanging out in the parking lot. When is the last time you were with a group of friends and thought, ""Hey the parking lot seems like a great place to just hang out, we should go out there."" It's just not a normal activity. As you said, they were waiting for AAA, that's not a normal activity. She was right to be suspicious and completely bungled the situation.  I also agree that they shouldn't have had to ""cower away"", but again think about the context. This lady is clearly not in a right state of mind. She's obviously intoxicated, it's best to not engage these kinds of people. You have no idea what an intoxicated person might do. She had a large purse, there could have been a firearm in there. Why would you risk escalating the situation?  You can't just ignore the context of what is happening here and just throw a race card out. Nothing I've described has anything to do with race.

"So here's an interesting tidbit in this article:  >At GeekGirlCon this weekend in Seattle, six members of the Dungeons and Dragons team from Wizards of the Coast, the company behind D&D, described efforts to go beyond the stereotypes and appeal to more players, including women, people of color and even middle-schoolers. Each worked on the game during the development of its most recent edition, which launched in 2014.  The paragraph in question doesn't say who the six women are, but later on is a picture of them, underneath which is a caption:  >Members of the Dungeons and Dragons team spoke about their experiences working on the game and its effort to expand into more diverse player groups at GeekGirlCon in Seattle.   It then names each of them: ""Left to right: Jaden Emme, Shelly Mazzanoble, Trish Yochum, Kate Irwin, Liz Schuh, Emi Tanji.""  Okay, fair enough. But I wasn't familiar with most of those names, so I checked LinkedIn for their work profiles, since I was curious what role they'd played in designing D&D Fifth Edition. Here's what I found:  **Jaden Emme:** I couldn't find a listing for her at all, on LinkedIn or anywhere else. I have no idea what her job title is or what role she played in developing D&D 5E.  **Shelly Mazzanoble:** Author of *Confessions of a Part-Time Sorceress*, Shelly's bio on LinkedIn says that she's been an Associate Brand Manager at WotC since 1998, and moved up to (non-Associate) Brand Manager in June of 2017. I'm suspicious of the idea that this involved much actual design or development work.  **Trish Yochum:** According to her LinkedIn profile, Trish Yochum was a Senior Manager of WotC's in-house Graphic Design Group from 2000-2007, after which she apparently left the company for several other jobs as well as a long stint of self-employment. She rejoined Wizards of the Coast as a Graphic Designer in April of 2018.  **Kate Irwin:** Kate Irwin has been an Art Director for Wizards of the Coast since August of 2000. (Presumably this involved D&D and Magic: the Gathering both?)  **Liz Schuh:** Her LinkedIn profile states that Liz Schuh has been Wizards of the Coast's Head of Publishing and Licensing for Dungeons & Dragons since August of 1995. Again, I question how much design and development this job involves.  **Emi Tanji:** Emi Tanji has, according to LinkedIn, been a Senior Graphic Designer for Wizards of the Coast since 2007, and an Art Director for WotC since February of 2018.  So there you have it. Most of the women that were said to have ""worked on the game during the development of its most recent edition"" seem to have been involved with the artwork (which, to be fair, is a perennial hot-button issue for regressives) or were involved with licensing and brand management. At least one (Trish Yochum) doesn't appear to have been involved during the development period at all, unless she was an outside contract. (I don't have my 5E books with me to check.) Either way, aside from issues of the art, this really seems to be stretching the definition of ""involved.""

The law was upheld to be valid as long as the work is deemed [obscene per the miller test](LINK in both the [Whorley](LINK and [Handley](LINK cases. The Handley case did cite that the sections that don't also require the work to be deemed obscene were too overbroad but they also cited that, ""This conclusion has minimal impact on this case given the almost complete redundancy of the conduct criminalized by subsections 1466A(a)(1) and (b)(1) (SIC: The sections requiring obscenity) with that of subsections 1466A(a)(2) and (b)(2) (SIC: The sections not requiring obscenity).""

Being convicted of this law along with other violations doesn't negate the fact that loli pornography, which is going to be deemed obscene, is still illegal all on it's own. Also it's important to realize that prosecutions for this are really rare. It's typically used as a way to add time to a sentence or as a way to get you for something if their original accusations fail in a similar fashion to how Al Capone was convicted of tax evasion.  >If prosecutions are so rare than it doesn't matter.    It's true the prosecutions are rare, as LewdGamer's essay clearly outlined. It's as likely for a private citizen nobody to get caught solely for this as they are of being caught downloading movies off a bit torrent. However keep in mind that is only going to apply ""nobodies"". Public corporations and public figures are under greater scrutiny.

"						> TL;DR: Stick to 2D, and you won't have any legal issues. In the absolute worst case you'll be hit with an obscenity charge, but even if you are, you can contact the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund and they will defend you for free.  This isn't a very sane analysis of those cases. Nothing you've posted doesn't prove it's not illegal. It [clearly is](LINK and [has survived scrutiny](LINK under several cases. It's just that, similar to piracy and myriad [other stupid laws](LINK you are very unlikely to be prosecuted unless you are already being targeted. The same way you aren't going to get a ticket for not wearing a seat belt unless you are caught doing something else too.  However, **and this is the important part**, companies and very public entities don't have the luxury of fading into obscurity the way citizens do, and they already have leverage on them in the form of business licences. If they're big enough they might be able to bribe themselves out of it but they can't exactly afford a public media blitz that they distribute child pornography. That's why you are going to see this stuff being banned on platforms and censored by translation companies, because even if it's likely that the private citizen isn't going to get nabbed for this sort of thing that's not a risk anyone is willing to take with their company and investor's money.  *Also you are sorely misrepresenting the ruling in the [Christopher Hadley Case](LINK What happened in that case was the court re-affirmed that Hadley could be charged under the PROTECT Act of 2003 as long as the material was deemed obscene. That's why he plea bargained after that determination, because he knew full well his material would be deemed obscene and he'd be convicted anyway. Here's a quote from the case that makes it very clear. It's not a separate obscenity charge. It's another provision under the same law which has the same penalty, and you still get put on the sex offender registry as well.  >**This conclusion has minimal impact on this case given the almost complete redundancy of the conduct criminalized by subsections 1466A(a)(1) and (b)(1) with that of subsections 1466A(a)(2) and (b)(2). The observable differences between these subsections are (1) subsections 1466A(a)(1) and (b)(1) incorporate the Miller test as essential elements, whereas subsections 1466A(a)(2) and (b)(2) do not; (2) subsections 1466A(a)(2) and (b)(2) include the “appears to be” language in relation to “a minor;” and (3) subsections 1466A(a)(1) and (b)(1) encompass a broader list of sexually explicit conduct.** > ...  > >The indictment in this case simply charges Defendant with violations of subsections 1466A(a) and (b). There is no reference to whether Defendant is being charged under subsections 1466A(a)(1) or (a)(2), or (b)(1) or (b)(2). The conduct outlined in count one states sufficient facts to allege a violation of § 1466A(a)(1), and the conduct outlined in counts two through four state sufficient facts to allege violations of § 1466A(b)(1). Because subsections 1466A(a)(1) and (b)(1) incorporate the three-prong Miller test for obscenity, these portions of the statute are not overbroad in violation of the Due Process Clause. The conduct alleged in the superseding indictment delineates violations of those constitutional portions of the statute; therefore, Defendant’s argument that the entire superseding indictment must be dismissed based on overbreadth must fail.   It also follows in line with the [Whorley case's](LINK finding.  >But in making his argument, Whorley ignores the language of § 1466A(a)(1), which prohibits visual depictions of minors only when they are obscene. See 18 U.S.C. § 1466A(a)(1)(B). Ashcroft itself noted that obscenity in any form is not protected by the First Amendment. See Ashcroft, 535 U.S. at 245- 46; see also Miller, 413 U.S. at 24; Kaplan, 413 U.S. at 119. Thus, regardless of whether § 1466A(a)(1) requires an actual minor, it is nonetheless a valid restriction on obscene speech under Miller, not a restriction on non-obscene pornography of the type permitted by Ferber. **We thus find Whorley’s as applied constitutional challenge to § 1466A(a)(1) to be without merit**.",0.0,Gab + Reddit,benchmark,3

Result: Suicide Prevention Breifing on Sunday, and everybody had to attend [*in full Dress Blues*](LINK Because of the Dorm guard duty, I was running something like thirty hours without sleep when I walked into that hot stuffy theater wearing that stuffy dress jacket with all the other airman to watch that stupid video. By the time it was over I was sleeping standing with my eyes open, and my buddies had to steer me back to our dorm by hand so I didn't fall over.  There's also the Keesler shuffle.  I hated the Keesler shuffle.  We did Physical Training every day, and one part of that was a run around the Triangle.  Some Airman would go at the slowest run possible, and if you walked you got in trouble, but *many* aimen* would do this half walk/half jog that made this scraping noise on the concrete that could be heard all over the place, especially if a lot of airmen were doing it.

"Despite having a trans girlfriend, I’ve been lurking meta since I discovered it this spring. I generally agree with most of the viewpoints of the posters here, from gun control, the insanity of the left, the anti illegal immigration sentiments, JT, Pro Bernier, affirmative action, etc. Even on a lot of the trans issues; regardless of how I feel about my gf, i totally get how it’s weird to most people, and I frankly have no issue if you want to call her a man. I mean, it’s an asshole move and lacks grace if you do it to a person’s face, but I won’t hate you for it, I get it (I’m a huge Shapiro fan, and he does not mince words on the subject). Im Pro Jordan Peterson (as is my trans gf)  But I will guess that most of the “hate” towards trans people on meta is coming from people who have never actually met or had a conversation with a trans person. Like any segment, there are crazies, and likely a higher percentage than in gen pop, sure. But calling trans people mentally retarded and saying they can’t do a job that has nothing to do with their gender really is pure hate. I would never say you folks don’t have the right to say it, I’m a free speech absolutist, but you do nothing but hurt your side of the political spectrum. Yes, the left is filled with hate at the moment, but you are just continuing the cycle and turning away folks like me who are on board with most things that the PPC party champions. It’s fine to have your opinion, but to have that much hate for people (CANADIANS) you have never met is telling more of you than of them.   Not all trans folks are activists trying to change our society, most I have met are actually the opposite; opposed to the activism, they don’t want that spotlight, they just want to lead normal lives. There currently isn’t any drug/therapy that helps trans people as much as actually transitioning does, until that time this is in a lot of cases the best course of action for a happier life.  I would also like to note, that not all trans people are actually legit gender dysmorphic, I have met a few that are straight up flaming gay dudes that took it too far. You know what that means, being able to tread that line?It’s called nuance, something sorely lacking on both sides. I hate the crazy left, but the vitriol from some here is just as bad.

There's not much reason to do the same to a whole state.  Recognize the elected leadership as a summary of certain balances and proportions of opinion, yes, but recognize it as only that.  We should address it as what it is.   'Just nuke California' is probably about as meaningless and unhelpful as 'just genocide all white people.'   Just emotion and stigma.

"In America it will largely come down to a constitutional challenge for the first person that doesn't settle with a plea deal. Like with the masturbatory aid bans, which were also predicated on obscenity, it requires a court challenge to overturn obviously unconstitutional prohibitions on 1st amendment speech.  Also, to anyone claiming ""muh 10th amendment,"" that only works for powers not already delegated to the people/fed. The 1st amendment, like the 2nd, is largely inviolable and cannot be constrained by state law just because they vote to do it. The states don't have the right to curtail 1st amendment speech that is guaranteed by the Constitution at large. Just because they regularly do, doesn't mean it doesn't also regularly get overturned after lengthy court battles.  This is why states like California routinely get slapped by the Supreme Court for gross unconstitutional acts.  As a further on this, keep in mind that ""nudie mags"" as a whole were considered illegal in the United States until recently, as far as history is concerned. When you see people say that something is illegal, you have to keep in mind that while the State may find it illegal, it doesn't mean that the court will when forced to examine it. Obscenity laws have been dying a slow death of a million court battles for decades, and no higher court *wants* to rule on something being an obscenity or not, because then they will have to once and for all define what an obscenity is without completely trashing the 1st amendment, a feat that they simply can't do, since the Miller test is the most ambiguous and ill-defined standard applicable.  As a passing last time edit, obscenity law reflects possibly the last gasp of moralism in United States common law. The great majority of laws focus on the verifiable parties involved with a dispute, the verifiable harm or offense committed, and the verifiable damage of said acts. There is a lack of passion, or focus on right or wrong, in law. There is only what happened, and the facts about what happened. Only in the resolution of a trial does the depravity of a person's conscience in committing acts sway the punishment of those acts. But obscenity is ill-defined, lacks any victims, cannot be tied to a particular public act, and criminalizes the conscience of the accused. It is only ""wrong"" because others are offended by it. No act of deprivation is tied to its existence, nobody is harmed by its creation or dissemination, and it can only be illegal because the State is making a moral stand. If anything, the world would be better by removing this topic from the State's hands once and for all.  Obscenity law is the SJW's wet dream as created by the extreme right. There is functionally no difference between hate speech as envisioned by the extreme left, and obscenity law as crafted by the extreme right.",0.0,Gab + Reddit,benchmark,3

"			Yep. Cannabis is the middle of nowhere (and even city) police departments’ bread and butter. Under current federal legislation it is permissible for departments to seize assets whenever they have “reasonable suspicion” that the suspect has been distributing “narcotics”. They DO NOT HAVE TO PROVE THIS IN COURT. THE SUSPECT CAN BE CLEARED OF ALL CHARGES AND THEY CAN KEEP THEIR SEIZED MONEY AND PROPERTY. Up to 90% of assets seized can be kept by the seizing local authorities, with the remainder being handed up the food chain to the feds.     The reason given is that it strangles cartels by cutting off their resources. Can they explain seizing a couple’s home because their son was accused of selling small quantities of drugs? Pretty sure these otherwise unblemished citizens are not secretly El Chapo. SERIOUSLY GOOGLE IT.     Here’s where marijuana comes in. Because of the PROVEN fact that marijuana does not have physically addictive properties, causes no craving or withdrawal beyond that which would be experienced by someone if you took their television away, it is a substance that you have a decent chance of finding at any given stop and search. Every kind of person in this country smokes weed. The CEOs, the preachers, the moms, the saints, the sinners. It has zero impact on a normal healthy person’s ability to function and live a normal, successful life. Its “addictive” properties are like those of sex or food, it’s only addictive to someone who has problems with emotions, self control, and/or discipline. Most humans can pick it up and put it down as they please, and those who can’t would have found something to have a problem with anyway. Leaving marijuana as a schedule 1 narcotic and continuing the charade of pretending to believe that it “kills kids” is what keeps local law enforcement in business in Bumblescum, NowhereState. Unlike the NYPD where they have plenty of tax dollars rolling in per capita and they just use marijuana statutes to intimidate and harass an overwhelmingly poor and marginalized sector of the city, there is not enough actual crime to sustain their justifications for keeping a force at all, let alone a force as large as they do have, and there is no money in taking down actual criminals (like rapists). So what is a corrupt police/sheriff’s department to do?    You are a victim of the continuing playacting where law enforcement and other institutions pretend that they genuinely believe that marijuana is “a dangerous drug”.    Everyone I have spoken to in healthcare understands that the health risks come from smoking via combustion methods and have the same risks as smoking cigarettes, except without a proven addictive substance involved that causes clinically documented physical craving and withdrawal. Additionally, the several contacts I have in law enforcement are extremely aware that marijuana is a relatively benign substance that is used as a tool against poor and dark people.    Read the description of the first hearing to make marijuana illegal. They have a direct quote of an argument used to justify the legislation that I will paraphrase here: “.. you give a Mexican in the field a puff of a marijuana cigarette and he thinks he’s a bullfighter in Toledo”. More racism and classism. On the federal level, they claimed to have “isolated the active ingredient “ and injected it into dogs’ brains, a couple of which died. THC was not isolated and identified until WWII or possibly just after. This “study” was “performed” many years before this discovery.        An educated population is the only cure, but I doubt it will happen in my lifetime. ",0.0,Gab + Reddit,benchmark,3

"Reading the study, a lot of the supposed identifying features of ""Russian trolls"" sound like people from 4chan.  >16 of these 33 troll/sock puppet accounts appear to be Russian trolls, or at least possess several of the Russian troll characteristics presented above. 7 of the 16 had auto-generated handles consisting of a very common, English name followed by a series of seemingly random digits, and five of those seven had not uploaded a profile image, a combination which according to the studies mentioned above, is a typical characteristic of Russian troll accounts.  Those usernames are the ones *Twitter itself* autogenerates if you don't bother to come up with a username when you make an account. Not mentioning this reflects either gross ignorance or misrepresentation.  >An example of an account that almost sums up these Russian troll characteristics carries an auto-generated handle and has almost exclusively tweeted disparagingly about The Last Jedi, and engaged in “anti-SJW” rhetoric. In the middle of these tweets, the account all of a sudden tweeted in support of Donald Trump during the latter’s visit to the United Kingdom, which was met with large protests in London. Besides not containing any personal information, having no profile picture and other Russian troll characteristics, this account only posted 9 tweets in more than a year from its creation in January 2017 to February 2018, all of them regarding a particular Anime series on YouTube. From April 2018 onwards, during the lead-up to the release of The Last Jedi for the home video market, and in anticipation of Solo: A Star Wars Story opening, the account suddenly comes to life and begins tweeting frequently about The Last Jedi, identity politics and Rian Johnson. After the data was collected, the account has been through a “reset” where many of its public tweets have been deleted, leaving only its replies.  Gee, I wonder if there's any other demographic besides paid shills for the Russian government who don't care about Twitter enough to bother making a username or uploading a profile picture, value their privacy enough to not upload personal information and to periodically purge tweets, dislike SJWs, like Donald Trump, dislike TLJ, and like anime.  >One of the above-mentioned accounts which has now been deleted by Twitter exhibited some of the lingual characteristics that researchers have observed in Russian troll tweets. On July 11, @USER tweeted: “So, now explain why Mark Hamil didn't like Luje in TLJ?”. The simplicity and brevity of the language, as well as the fact that this purported Star Wars fan doesn’t spell “Hamill” or “Luke” correctly, are all indicators that raises suspicions. In combination with other characteristics (auto-generated handle, lack of personal matter on account etc.), the verbiage suggests that the user may be a Russian troll. The literature suggests that Russian trolls primarily use mobile apps for Twitter posts, and thus auto-correct and word suggestion on smartphones disguise any poor English skills to an extent.  J and K are next to each other in the English keyboard layout. It's obviously a typo, not someone who thinks Luke is spelled with a J.",0.0,Gab + Reddit,benchmark,3

"**Here's a trailer / store review (or personal impression, if you will):**   The first contact with your game is through its title and short description, and they already tell me this is a politically charged game, and that the game takes a clear side in the culture war. At this point, I heavily suspect it will be heavy handed and preachy. My suspicions are reinforced after I start watching the video, as it contains too many ""buzzwords"" which makes it seem like it's a game aimed at die hard anti-SJWs only, and makes it feel too forced. Should be more subtle with these things.   The action and the written explanation on the store is not good enough to convey what the gameplay is about to most people. You should show and explain better the game mechanics. If people are confused about your game from the get go, they wont even bother downloading a demo, much less buying it to try and refund if they dislike.   The FAQ has a better explanation, but most users will not go out of their way and delve into the forum to try and figure out a game whose first impression was ""being weird"", ""clusterfuck"" or ""confusing gameplay"".  I obviously didnt play the game, but the feeling I get from the material presented is that the SJW theme is just a skin that could be ripped off from the game and it wouldnt change the experience one bit, or even make it better from not feeling so forced or preachy. It feels like an after thought since it doesnt seem like its integrated to the gameplay aspect of the game. You could turn this into an office battle royale themed around office rage and disfunctional work relationships and it would be all the same, or possibly work better.  I don't mean to sound harsh or anything, these are just my personal, unfiltered thoughts from my first contact with the store. In this context, my personal reaction would be to click ""not interested"" and ignore it.   Your game is competing for attention with not only thousands of others, but also with the backlog of each steam gamer. Your first battle is to grab the interest of the public to keep looking at your video or reading your description. Your second one is to aptly convey what your game is all about, how it plays and instill a desire on the user to go out of their way and buy it in a short video and / or description.

In the years past I have been hailed as a champion - for 7 straight years I have spent November as a chastitised christian. I hoped to continue this legacy. And last night, I failed.  One as regal as I, failing? Impossible. Only the gods could achieve such power to stop me. I guess that night I was dealing with a god.  I'm on the YouTube homepage, trying to find some epic Morgz videos, when I stumble upon a certain video. This damn video. Its bright thumbnail, its captivating title - it utterly fascinated me. This cursed video: it was none other than “Fortnite's most EPIC event EVER!”, posted by the one and only Ali A.  My body immediately began to shake, and my penis shot straight up. The most EPIC event EVER? What could it be? I felt a pull towards the video like I had never felt before. It took me awhile to realize the effect the video was having on me. I fell back in my chair in fear. In agony. In complete and utter despair.  My hand instinctively grabbed the mouse and began to slowly slide over to the thumbnail. I kicked and screamed and cried, trying and failing to stop my body. Sweat was dripping down my entire body. Minutes later, the pointer had finally reached its destination. And with a cry, the hand that didn't feel like mine anymore clicked.  I was immediately met with a scream. “THIS IS IT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!” Purple light streamed from the computer monitor and began to fill the room. The voice on the screen continued talking, seemingly in an ancient tongue. My entire body began to quiver as something awakened inside of me. My speakers began to shake as something inside of them grew louder. Was this music? Or was this something else?  The music finally picked up, and immediately, as Ali's intro began, I came harder and faster than I ever had before. The sensation rendered me unconscious. The last thing I remember seeing that night was my cum streaked over his face. And it looked like he was smiling.  I woke up to a rising sun. My clothes were back on, my sweat was wiped away, and my penis was flaccid. I could finally see again. Was this all a dream? No, there’s no way. It felt too real.  My suspicions were immediately crushed as I looked to the monitor. In a drunk stupor, it looks like I had changed my desktop background to a picture of him. He was staring into my heart - into my soul. And he was covered in my cum.  So, guys, whatever you do, don’t watch Ali A's newest video. Anybody less powerful than I would surely be dead. Stay safe this November - deny Fortnite.   ",0.0,Gab + Reddit,benchmark,3

"								Yes, because the only way in which words/usages are right or wrong is by the judgement of the speaker or listeners. It is possible and downright *acceptable* for listeners to judge that speakers usage of a word is wrong.  Dictionaries neither endorse nor condemn, they only care about existence. To extend your example, the word ""nigger"" is in all English-language dictionaries, along with usage notes that tell you it is *extremely* offensive to almost everyone. Almost anybody you said the word to would punch your lights out for saying it. The dictionary did its job - it recorded that English speakers use (or used) this word, and it recorded that it upsets English speakers so much that they won't tolerate use of the word. Dictionaries don't make value judgements, but **you should**.  By all means, out-pedant me about emphasisers vs intensifiers. But also note that ""fantastically"" and ""incredibly"" are also intensifiers, and their original meanings are ""in the realm of fantasy"" and ""lacking credibility"". Your examples don't show that words meaning ""in truth"" should go on to become intensifiers, because words meaning the opposite have also gone on to become intensifiers. There's no moral, logical or etymological reason to let ""literally's"" ""not literally"" meaning stand, and the more you fight it, the more you can reduce its adoption, and with luck it will drop out of usage.",0.0,Gab + Reddit,benchmark,3

I don't think it really needs to be said that the word ""nigger"" is clearly disliked for completely different and much more justifiable reasons.

Language isn't built on logic the same way that math is, and there is absolutely no moral reason to hate this usage, so the onus is on you to justify why it's bad, and not people who use it as an intensifier.  It's also been in use as such since before any living person was born, so there's your etymological reason to leave it alone.  This isn't a recent change, which means you probably lost the fight before you even knew the word.  The words ""bleach"" and ""black"" share an etymological root, but nobody gets in a huff about them having to do with opposite colors.

This sort of language needs to be combatted and driven out of public discourse, lest we end up with a nation of simple-minded fools electing a charlatan to lead them.

It's always the same shit from male feminists: collective blame to alleviate the weight on their own consciences.   It's a common coping mechanism. The man who authored this is in a grey zone where he's clearly a bad person, but still has strong enough of a conscience to recognize his behavior as shitty. This puts him in an awkward predicament where he'll treat people like garbage and then feel bad about it later.   So he does the typical and states the problem isn't with *him*, but with *men in general*. You see, now it's suddenly not his fault. He now suddenly feels a whole lot better about himself. The best part is he didn't even really admit to any wrongdoing. Remember: it's not actually his fault. It's society's fault!   >I speak as an insider. I know about what so many of us men think about women — the language we use, the sense of power that we garner through our sexual exploits, our catcalling and threatening, our sexually objectifying gazes, our dehumanizing and despicable sexual gestures and our pornographic imaginations. This is not simply locker room banter but a public display of unchecked bravado for which we often feel no shame.  He loudly proclaims, shouting through cupped hands on a rooftop, that the feminists were right all along! Men *are* sexist, and he's willing to tell them what happens behind closed doors. He's on their side. Feminists cheer in unison because that's what they really wanted. A good male ally doesn't talk about how the overwhelming majority of men are decent people. A good male ally tells women that every inching suspicion they had about men was true all along.   >Since the world is watching, we, as men, need to join in the dialogue in ways that we have failed to in the past.

" 									>The Peculiar History of the “Negro-Ape Metaphor” Dehumanizing representations of African peoples are nearly as old as Europeans’ first contact with West Africa (Ovington, 1929).

As  theories  of  race  moved  from  theological  to biological,  the  rationale  for  racial  hierarchy  relied  even  moreheavily on the “Negro-ape metaphor,” as Lott (1999) described it. Although this linkage predates scientific racism, it drew increased interest and popularity when Franz Boas, the preeminent anthro- pologist  of  his  time,  and  even  Charles  Darwin,  speculated  that there  might  be  an  evolutionary  spectrum  among  primates  (Lott, 1999)  containing  monkeys  and  apes  at  the  least  evolved  end, continuing through savage and/or deformed anthropoids, and cul- minating with Whites at the other end (as most evolved; Jahoda, 1999).

Personally, I don't think we should make a huge deal about under-21's drinking, but the law's the law, and here's why she's wrong:  She told the cops that she was 20.  Being underage and in possession of alcohol is a crime (MIC).  When a police officer has reasonable suspicion or probable cause of a person committing a crime, that suspect MUST identify themselves to the police.  They gave her the chance to show that an overage person was the one with the alcohol, which not only did she not take, but she was really rude to them when they were very patient with her trashy, belligerent, entitled behavior.     If you refuse to identify yourself at this point, you can be arrested - period.  By trying to walk away, she's evading/resisting, and when she pushes the officer, now it's resisting arrest AND felony assaulting a police officer in addition to the MIC.  Then when she kicks the other cop (another count of assaulting a police officer), they treated her like they would any man, and rightly so.  Lastly,  when she tried (and failed) to spit on the officer, that's yet ANOTHER count of attempted assault of a police officer, as bodily fluids count in that category.  On top of that, the whole time she is screaming about how her child is there, using that child as a shield, etc., but the worst part is that's the example she's setting for her kid.",0.0,Gab + Reddit,benchmark,3

All those issues he brings up, could have been given to any other of the cardboard cut-out vampire generals to bring up, actually flesh them out a bit instead of just being stand-ins, and leave Godbrand to be the brash douchebag that still accidentally ruins part of Carmilla's plans.

"				> Do you think the media as a whole, Internet, newspaper, radio and TV portray worse conditions than actually exist?     I think that there are a lot of people who became journalists for the wrong reason, to drive a personal agenda, and that this is leading to a lot of the divisiveness we currently see everywhere.    I'll start with a comparative example, and then draw a parallel to gaming to explain myself:    One prime example would be when CNN posted that vid of Sylville Smith's sister claiming that she was calling for peace.   In reality, she was telling the rioters to ""take that shit to the suburbs, burn their shit down.""   While CNN ended up posting an apology after having been lambasted for it everywhere, it shouldn't have happened to begin with.    We experience similar things in gaming.   One example would be the firing of two arenanet employees after abysmal behaviour towards customers.   The gaming journalists responded by saying that 'people shouldn't be fired by mob rule.'   Then when Good Old Games published a tweet with the #willnotbeerased hashtag (or however it's written) and shortly after deleted it, those same journalists were calling for the employee that wrote the tweet to be fired.    These kinds of double standards have seemingly become extremely common in journalism as a whole.   Which brings me back to the argument i was making:   ""I think that there are a lot of people who became journalists for the wrong reason, to drive a personal agenda"", these kind of journalists refuse to criticise the side that they emphasize with, and go out of their way to criticize those they consider their opposition over the smallest thing.   As a result, we see a disproportionate amount of claims of sexism, transphobia, homophobia and racism, because to them merely criticising someone who possesses certain immutable traits can only come from hatred of said immutable traits.    > Outside of the competitive scene, players who just genuinely lack skill or time into the game typically see a lot of backlash. My own personal experience was when I started playing Counter strike and league of legends (casual modes)    Just because you aren't playing these games ranked, doesn't mean that the games themselves aren't competitive in nature.    To draw a better comparison you should try to play a game that has both a popular PvP mode and a separate coop mode (against AI).   You' wont get yelled at nearly as much when you are new while playing the coop mode, than you will while playing the PvP mode.   Though there might be one specific exception to this, and that is when you are playing the hardest content in the game, and success depends entirely on every participants contribution.    > When I first started out I was met with a lot of harsh comments followed by being told to uninstall after I just finished the installation. Do you think its sub communities based on specific games that create a narrative of oppression or is it just media?    When they tell you to uninstall the game, it has nothing to do with your gender, skincolour or any other such trait, they just consider you to be really bad at the game.   That said, trashtalking in games **can** be aimed at any such trait, but in most cases that isn't because they actually hate or fear someone over those traits, but because they are trying to get to someone.    Often you'll see that the same person that calls a black guy a nigger in one match will end up calling a white guy a KKK member and a nazi in the next, and then the match after that they'll tell a jew that they'd wished that 'hitler had done a better job'.

Your emails are private communications. You literally have (under American law) an expectation of privacy which even the police are not allowed to violate without proper judicial and legal grounds.  Usenet is perhaps a better example because it is a public forum that employs a similar model of moderation to email. The ISP Usenet servers oftentimes filtered spam and the binary groups, but the posts themselves weren't removed from the system; so you could usually pay for access to servers that didn't filter. And while some groups were moderated, others weren't; and the moderated groups maintained their own rules. If you preferred to read the unmoderated groups, a client-side killfile provided crude means for user-controlled filtering.  Usenet's technical considerations aside, I think modern platforms would get less push-back if they adopted/improved upon that approach to moderation: the platform just serves you the messages, lets you post, and provides tools for users and groups to moderate as they see fit without global posting guidelines. If something is actually illegal (in the ""forward to the FBI upon removal"" sense), or a court orders its removal, then the admins can pull it.  > The report specifically tells them to be politically neutral as part of being more consistent with their rules because tech companies haven't been.

It is the mindset that jumps to the same victim-complex basis as the complete opposite side of the spectrum.   I found this article particularly inciteful. It was quite well balanced, and instead of being for or against a given party, it settled for presenting a great number of facts that evidently placed the professor under suspicion. I wish more articles were written like this.

"	well I have brown skin and I am a shit singer on the shower but I prefer chile spicy over spice spicy so no, completely sure not an indian although I agree the culture of nailing husbands to the wall is similar.  On the case above the guys resulted to be actually decent and likeable, but they are still poor.  i never went MGTOW in the sense its a relatively new term to me. I simply decided out of my own to focus on myself rather than waste money on girls and dating. When I actually went on dates I had some rules I religiously followed.  - Make sure you can have fun alone on the date if she doesnt show up or simply dont like each other. For example watch a movie you will like regardless if you are with company. - Think how much you would spend alone, if the date goes well you can increase the amount but only if she agrees to be the one paying the second time. - Kisses and sex early, if she wants to wait for whatever reason its ok, dont push it. The best way to not push it is to stop dating. - Make sure she knows you dont want an stable relationship in a natural way. she will bring the subject 'casually' so just answer equally 'casually'. - Spend at least the same time and money on fun as you spend improving yourself, fun includes fun alone and dating.  I have many good stories to tell on how I learned and applied each lesson, maybe will sometime.  I dont date anymore because I am living with a girl who doesnt want to get married and knows I will literally flee the country if she tries to nail me. She also has an extreme case of tokophobia LINK and she would literally gag if she sees a pregnant woman so pregnancy is less likely.

I was giving examples of how a patriarchal society can harm men. I thought that was obvious.   And yes, the men who are congratulating children who get raped are not feminists and embrace toxic masculinity that says males must enjoy sexual attention no matter what and if you don’t want to have sex you have the strength to fight off an attacker.  No feminist would congratulate a rape victim.

"Prosecutors have decided not to charge Long Beach Councilwoman Jeannine Pearce with domestic violence or driving under the influence in connection with a June clash with her former chief of staff.  But a district attorney’s memo detailing the decision also raises questions about the Long Beach Police Department’s response to the June 3 incident involving the councilwoman and Devin Cotter.  In its initial statement, the Police Department said it received a call for assistance from the California Highway Patrol about a possible drunk driving incident on the shoulder of the 710 Freeway in Long Beach at 2:40 a.m.  The city’s officers smelled alcohol on Pearce, who admitted to drinking that night, according to the district attorney’s memo. A field sobriety test conducted about 4 a.m. showed she was mildly impaired.  But the memo said a test of the councilwoman’s blood-alcohol level was not conducted until 4:20 a.m., nearly two hours after the CHP called. At that point, the test showed Pearce had a blood-alcohol level of 0.06%, under the legal limit of 0.08%, the memo said.  The testing device used on Pearce was unreliable, the prosecutor’s memo said. A department toxicologist had recommended it not be used a month before the incident. Additional tests were not performed, according to the district attorney’s memo.  A police spokesman said in a statement that officers initially investigated whether domestic violence had occurred when they arrived, interviewing Cotter and Pearce before realizing that the councilwoman had been drinking. At that point, the officers called for a colleague who is a certified drug recognition expert to investigate, Sgt. Brad Johnson said in the statement.  He said the testing device had been “tagged to be replaced but was not removed from its storage cabinet. The officer who retrieved the device did not realize ... and unfortunately used it during the DUI investigation.”  Police at the scene saw Cotter with swelling, redness and a cut to his head and cuts to his hand, according to the district attorney’s memo. Pearce at one point had shoved Cotter, causing him to fall to the ground, the memo said.  Prosecutors ultimately decided that Pearce, who was elected to the City Council in 2016, could argue she was defending herself when she shoved Cotter.  In an email to The Times, Pearce said Cotter had thrown her “keys, iPad, and many other things” off to the side of the road during the argument on the freeway shoulder. Asked about the delay in time between the arrival of responding officers and the administering of a sobriety test, Pearce said she was questioned about the confrontation with Cotter for “some time” while the investigators were “waiting on someone that was bringing the Breathalyzer.”  Cotter, who could not be reached for comment, served as campaign manager for Mayor Robert Garcia when he was elected in 2014 and later served as a legislative deputy to him until July 2016, according to Cotter’s LinkedIn page. He then left to work as Pearce’s chief of staff until February 2017. Pearce and Cotter had “dated before, during and after” the June 3 incident, according to the district attorney’s memo.  The two had been driving back from a concert, where both had been drinking, when the altercation occurred, according to the memo. An argument ensued, and Pearce struck Cotter on the arm because he was “causing the car to dangerously swerve” on the freeway, the memo said.  Both gave “multiple inconsistent statements and thus both have proved to be inaccurate reporters of fact,” Deputy Dist. Atty. Janis Johnson wrote in the memo. But evidence supported the councilwoman’s final version of the events over Cotter’s, Johnson concluded.  Among the evidence was a text message Pearce sent to her new chief of staff asking for help and a video the councilwoman took that showed Cotter yelling a threat to release disparaging information about her to “the press, her husband and her employer if she did not meet certain demands while holding her car keys,” Johnson wrote.  Long Beach police previously said officers did not find “sufficient cause” to arrest either Pearce or Cotter at the scene. Pearce was driven home by a friend, according to police, and Cotter was taken home by the responding officers.  Cotter tried to confront Pearce again hours later outside her home, the councilwoman said. He was arrested on suspicion of public intoxication a short time later, according to police.  In a statement released earlier this year, Pearce said she had been the victim of domestic violence in the months before the incident and that police were investigating, though she did not accuse anyone by name.  “Since late last year I have experienced escalating threats, harassment and stalking,” she wrote.  Pearce said those incidents remain under investigation by Long Beach police, and she declined to elaborate Thursday. She also expressed frustration that she had been cast as the aggressor in the incident.  “I find it frustrating that as the one that called [police], that was trapped, and was faced with fear that I was listed as the only suspect in the matter. This is one example of the challenges for women (and even men) in speaking up about psychological abuse,” Pearce wrote in the email. “The burden of proof is not a bruise on the outside, ones easily seen.”  Pearce has said she was not “pulled over” June 3, but had requested a police presence at the scene. Earlier this year, CHP’s Southern Division Chief Chris O’Quinn told The Times that his officers came upon Pearce and Cotter because they were involved in a “heated argument” on the side of the freeway.  Long Beach officers have closed their investigation into the June 3 incident, according to a statement released Wednesday. The district attorney’s Public Integrity Division is still conducting a separate investigation into “alleged inappropriate activity and conflicts of interest” in connection with the incident. A spokesman for the district attorney’s office declined to elaborate.",0.0,Gab + Reddit,benchmark,3

"		No, *a few* of Lovecraft’s stories had the kind of themes that suggest inspiration from his fear of miscegenation. *The Shadow Over Innsmouth*, *Facts Concerning the Late Arthur Jermyn and his Family*, and if you really reach you can fit *The Dunwich Horror* in there too. You also have some nakedly discriminatory stuff in *The Street* and *The Horror at Red Hook*, which even Lovecraft was like “these are garbage why did I write these”.

"	That's exactly what I was thinking. Besides the fact that over 80% of COs are male, and the fact that COs get charged for having sex with inmates, it's crazy improbable to find one willing to risk fucking her whole life up for a some dick.   This had to be a lower security prison, because in high security they usually have 2 officers on the block (one on the floor and one working the switches). But even with her probably being the only one on the floor, there's still cameras everywhere. This guy was probably the tier-man, so he had access to the supply closet after lock-down, but still it would be suspicious to have the officer missing for long periods of time.

They also have a bunch of other unrelated traits that SJWs don't like, just to make sure that you know to hate them.  Then they present a bunch of supposed counter-examples to the idea that pushing ""we're just like you"" is bad, but their counter-examples are nonsensical.  1. A woman complaining that she accused of having kids for welfare. I assume because she's black. I was under the impression that the 'B' in LGBT stood for 'bisexual', not 'black', shows what I know! 2. A woman complaining about being harassed and arrested on the suspicion of being a sex worker. It's not clear why from the avatar though, but I'm guessing she's supposed to be South-East Asian?

Giving them the benefit of the doubt that this is a real problem, it is actually relevant. What I'm failing to see is how that demonstrates a problem with ""just like you"" messaging.

Only necessarily insofar as we support the idea behind freedom of expression, association, etc.  In other words, it's a matter of principle, not necessarily a preference for the individual involved.  I can understand people with no principles being confused by this, so I will explain:  The principle being, tech and media companies should not be playing gatekeepers of morality, thought police as it were.  The precedent being that not even the government is supposed to do this.

Slavery used to be legal, for example.  If Jones wins, it would be a legal precedent that can potentially protect everyone, *including you.*  See also: Businesses that are big enough or virtual monopolies of quasi-necessary nature can have a bit more obligation than your average Ma&Pa brick and mortar store.  This is where other anti-discrimination laws above and beyond the basic constitutional amendments have come into play as arguments were made and justified  to protect the life and liberty of people who were being oppressed.  As in non-governmental employers or housing being liable for discrimination.  See:  LINK  It's not even necessarily legal.  Businesses that have a close relation to government can sometimes be liable for 1A breaches under ""state action"" or ""state actor"" connections. LINK  There's also always civil law, where people can sue for damages.  TL;DR It's the principle of the thing, not necessarily loyalty to Jones.

" 			You can actually murder the cop if he is illegally arresting you. You'll need loads of proof that you were innocent of the crime that he was arresting you for, but yeah, unlawful arrest is hella illegal and there are a lot of legal precedents where people legally killed cops that were illegally arresting them.  A lot of people have a deep-seeded love affair with cops though, so they'll tell you that you *have to* comply with any order that a cop ever makes of you. Those people are wrong. You can not only fight off a cop that is illegally arresting you, you can murder a cop that is illegally arresting someone else too. That is what the US Supreme Court has ruled. LINK  In your specific example about being confused with a burglar, however, it would probably be ruled these days that the cops had ""reasonable suspicion"" to arrest you; which is basically a catch-all for any and all behavior that a cop wants to do. So the real question is: how much of the law will a cop/judge bend in order to protect themselves in the event of an unlawful arrest? The answer is: a lot. A lot of the law will be bent and even broken in order to protect a cop that commits an unlawful arrest, so you therefore would likely not be able to exercise your *right* to defend yourself from cops. Kinda scary.  There are a plenty of cases though, even recently, where people are found innocent of murdering an unlawful cop... but most of those people still spent time in jail, and were even badly beaten by other police (see the Ray Rosas case), so you'll probably still miss your flight... but there was a guy that killed a cop in self defense then evaded other cops for 6 days and was still found not guilty, so who knows, you might be able to catch that flight after all.

"			Doesnt matter though. I would say the difference is almost certainly causes by a lack of intent and instead a cry for help. How could the researchers even possibly know that? Indeed the person themselves might not even realize they subconsciously took the less likely to kill you method  Its quite simple. Men kill themselves a lot more than women, so even if women Do attempt more, first the group that is actually dying should take preference, and second you have to ask if they do attempt more why are men dying at 4x the rate? The answer is because women take less certain suicide methods, but the only logical explanation for that is that it is a cry for help, even if subconsciously, because they know deep down people will help. Indeed there is no other logical explanation other than something as vain as ""women dont want to mess up their bodies"" which is much more ridiculous than suggesting its a cry for help.   There is only one logical explanation why women, if they do attempt more than men, only die at a quarter of the rate, and that is because they use it as a cry for help. If they actually had intent then they would choose a more certain methods. Indeed you say these researchers state it isnt due to lack of intent. First where is your evidence for this? Second, lets say that some researchers state that, what is the basis for it? Is it that they asked the woman and She said she intended to? If so thats bullshit, people will lie all the time to make themselves look less stupid, I certainly wouldnt want to be seen as looking for attention (not that that is what a cry for help is, but sadly some people see it that way) if asked so id probably lie too. Indeed even if we concede that they arent lying and believe they wanted to do it, the human psyche works on many levels and we do things we dont even think we in tend subconsciously a lot.  The reason that the while ""women attempt more"" claim is distracting bullshit can be split into the point below.   1. The evidence seems very shakey and is based on sources that vary wildly in their numbers. Furthermore it is ridiculous hard to define what counts as attempted suicide and what doesnt. Does someone slicing part of their forearm with a razor in a non lethal spot count? Someone taking a dose of paracetamol that is absolutely non lethal? Its so vague and undefined its practically useless. In contract someone actually killing themselves is a much more sturdy and verifiable figure  2. EVEN IF we are to assume that women attempt more, so what? Men are dying at 4x the rate, whether women attempt more is irrelevant we should absolutely prioritize the group actually fucking dying. Thats what I never got about the while ""women attempt more"" nonsense. Even if it is objectively true it doesnt matter as the group actually dying should be prioritize. Thats like saying ""4x more men died than women in said more"" and someone else saying ""yeah but more women got injured"". As related to above, not only is ""injured"" (just like ""attempted"") very vague, but its Also irrelevant, the group actually dying should be prioritized.  3. There is no other logical explanation that women apparently attempt at twice the rate but men die 4x more (I.e. For every 1 man who does 7 women attempt and only one dies) than woman arent using lethal methods on purpise as a cry for help. Indeed there arent any other logical conclusions, and there is far more sympathy and support for women than men regarding mental health issue, so that is the logical conclusion. Indeed you say that researchers assert that it is not due to a lack of intent to die. That poses a lot of questions. First why is this the one thing you havent provide sources for? Second what reasons do they give? Third, assuming the first and second question have a valid answer, how in the hell would they know, they arent the person themselves so it is impossible to tell what their actual intent is. Indeed people lie all the time when it comes to the intent of their actions. Not many suicide attempted who did do it as a cry for help are gna say ""yeah I never actually meant to kill myself I just wanted help"". Personally testimony is useless as people lie, especially in cases where it could seriously affect how people view them if they told the truth. Four, lets say that there is some evidence women dont have a less intent to die, and lets also assume none of them are lying if such evidence exists, its still useless because the person themselves mightnt know their intentions at the time. The human psycho works on many levels. Ever had a ""gut feeling""? Thats often your body picling up on subtle hints that you dont consciously process. Sinilarly, even if a woman thought she wanted to die, her body might have picked up that crying for help would provide her the help she needs leading her to subconsciously picking a less lethal methods.   4. Lets say you somehow met the above 3 points. What is the reason then that it takes 8 women attempting to have the same number of deaths as 1 man attempting? No counter theory and its all use less, and even if you do have one, unless you can satisfy the above Four points, it wont be valid  That is the problem. If it takes 8x the woman attempting to have the same numbers of deaths as guys (assuming 2x higher attempt rate in women, and 4x higher actual suicide rate in men) then the only logical conclusion is theyre crying for help. If you want to provide another theory thats fine. But stating ""researchers state they intent to kill themselves"" with out evidence is useless, even if you have that evidence its Also useless as it is impossible for the researchers to actually understand the intent of another person, even if they do have some kind of evidence to understand their intent (E. G. Questionnaires) that is also not very helpful as it would require the replyees to not be free lying about a topic they would likely be lying about, and if we assume they arent lying then that doesnt a count for lack of intent as we cant know what subconsciously processes might have take place, as many times people do things they wouldnt consciously or didnt consciously understand because they were doing do subconsciously. Indeed I may think Im doing XX for someone to be helpful, when my subconsciously intent is something completely different based in a past experience.  And as I say, even if by some niracle we assume that this evidence you havent provide of researchers who, if it does exist, can apparently read minds, and if it is based on statistical data like questionnaires requires the woman not to be lying AND to not have any subconscious actions which make even her unsure of her own actions, even IF we assume you somehow have some magical evidence that fits all the above criteria,  AND on top of that, they have a differening theory which logically resolve the great disrepancy between actual suicide attempt to death rate, even IF you have all that (hint:you dont), it doesnt matter. Why? Men are dying at 4x the rate, thats what matters. Those are the figure that matter.  Indeed that is the most disgusting part about the ""women attempt more"" statistic that gets thrown around. Even IF we are to assume its true and women attempt more and have just as much intent as men, it doesnt change the fact that men are dying that 4x the rate. This is people fucking lives this is the largest killer of men under 35 in the UK and many other countries. Trying to deflect away from that and make it a womans issue by saying ""well women attempt more so women are actually more oppressed by this"" while men are out their dying in droves is the most sickening thing of all. Its not a competition, this is people dying. The way feminists try to use that to try and deflect and down play the fact that men are dying in the masses from suicide and instead try to make it a womans issue, ignoring the fact that in doing so theyll be driving resources away from men and leading to many more deaths, is the most horrific part of all. Even if the extremely suspicious ""fact"" of women attempting more AND having just as much intent is true, throwing that around to make your side seem more oppressed and doing so taking resources and attention away from men who are actually dying, is the most disgusting thing you can do, and purely evidenced why people say feminist is fuck all about equality.",0.0,Gab + Reddit,benchmark,3

"Gab.com Statement on US Obscenity Law, Free Expression, and Loli Hentai   The poem Howl was nearly censored under obscenity laws in 1957. If you read it, you’ll note that it truely is a remarkable work of poetry.   In other words, it has artistic value in relation to the Miller Test, the three-prong obscenity test that is the United States Supreme Court's test for determining whether speech or expression can be labeled obscene.   The question of what is “obscene” and what is not is one of vigorous legal debate. Similar in nature to “hate speech,” the word “obscene” can be subjective in nature. The difference is obscenity laws have decades of legal precedent from SCOTUS, whereas “hate speech” was unanimously ruled as first amendment protected speech by SCOTUS in Matal v Tam (2016.)    Another prominent obscenity test is the Stewart Standard from Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U.S. 184 (1964) on what constitutes pornography and obscene content. This has been cited in Gab’s user guidelines since January 2nd 2017.   The Stewart Standard, more popularly described as “I know it when I see it,” is one of the most known Supreme Court phrases in history. It is “a colloquial expression by which a speaker attempts to categorize an observable fact or event, although the category is subjective or lacks clearly defined parameters.”  Now the difference between the poem Howl and hentai loli cartoons depicting babies, toddlers, and young children being sexually abused is ultimately all about visual obscenity. You can look at a poem, but not know how to read it. Say Howl was written in some bizarre alien language that no human knew. Would you say it was obscene? Certainly not. If the poem was read in 100 different languages that you did not speak, would you find it obscene? Of course not. Even if you find the poem extremely offensive, have those words seared an image in your brain that can not be unseen?   The same can not be said for loli hentai images that specifically depict what are very obviously infants and young children being sexually abused. The problem with the term “loli” is that it is very broad. It means different things to different cultures and groups of people. That is why we very specifically describe what we are referring to.   You can show that content to anyone of any language from any background at any time in history and they would have an instant reaction. That reaction would be overwhelming negative and very few if any would find artistic value in the content.   While porn itself would evoke a similar reaction, when the content in question very obviously depicts babies, toddlers, and very young children: under the Miller Test and the Steward Standard it would likely be deemed obscene by SCOTUS and most certainly by the average person.   Multiple US states agree that it is indeed obscene and illegal. Under federal law 18 USC 1466A loli hentai is a legal grey area.   Gab’s policy is to follow all applicable laws in The United States of America, the Constitution and the Supreme Court’s rulings on the First Amendment. We use the Court’s rulings, precedents and judgments as our guiding principles for protecting and empowering free speech and expression.   This is why we do not allow loli hentai images that specifically depict what are very obviously infants, babies, toddlers, and young children being sexually abused.",0.0,Gab + Reddit,benchmark,3

"Three-Quarters of Calais Migrants Mentally Ill – Report   Activist health professionals have sounded the alarm over the situation in Calais, where Doctors of the World claim three-quarters of the 500 migrants living in the hope of breaking into Britain are suffering from mental illness.  France Culture said the northern port town was facing a “public health emergency”, in a report Wednesday which marked two years since the dismantling of the so-called Jungle camp saw almost 6,500 migrants moved to asylum centres scattered across the country.   Despite ongoing efforts by authorities to clear the area of illegal immigrants, whose desperate and violent attempts to reach the UK have resulted in the death of at least one driver and the wounding of several police officers, between 450 to 500 would-be illegal migrants are still living in Calais, the public broadcaster reports.  Doctors of the World, whose volunteers hold regular mobile clinics for illegal immigrants in the areas of France in which they congregate, estimated that three in four of those in Calais and the 1,800 who lived at the Dunkirk-based Grande-Synthe camp — which was dismantled Tuesday — suffer from serious mental health problems.   A report by the open borders-backing NGO and France’s Primo Levi Centre revealed the most common conditions amongst immigrants residing illegally in the EU nation were psycho-traumatic syndromes, constituting 64 percent of mental conditions diagnosed between 2012 and 2016.   In addition to having suffered “extremely painful” circumstances in their homelands, and experienced “traumatic events” in the course of migrating to Europe, the mental health of asylum seekers is “degraded” further still upon their arrival in France, where problems are worsened as they face “rejection” and authorities “questioning their word” with regards to the hardships they have faced, according to the report.   Memory and concentration loss affecting illegal immigrants’ ability to recount their journey to France and the reasons they are seeking asylum is cited as a “disabling” psycho-traumatic symptom in the report, which claims the demands of the asylum registration process “increases [migrants’] suffering”.   “The violence to which exiles have been exposed, themselves or as witnesses, has long-term effects, not only on them but also on future generations,” asserts the report, claiming migrants are often suffering from “the transgenerational effects of psychotrauma”.   To this end, the NGOs recommended that authorities “take into account the degraded mental state and the extreme vulnerability” of illegal immigrants “in the context of narratives for the right to protection”, especially when assessing the claims of “unaccompanied children and adolescents”.   In order to solve the “public health emergency” of mental illness rates amongst the illegal immigrant population in France, the state should provide “immediate and unconditional shelter” to asylum seekers along with full entitlement to healthcare, according to the document, which neglects to examine the effect such measures would have on the number of people choosing to embark on the dangerous journey to Europe.

Proof is on the 47 hard drives whistleblower Montgomery gave to the FBI. Larry Klayman his attorney tried to get the Congress to see his proof President Trump before elected was spied upon last year. I am posting the link to Larry Klaymans letters to Congress. More information is posted today by me from audio tapes, proof of the testimony before the FBI in a secret place, and more. Just scroll through my timeline for more proof. Why else would they not talk to him? He had the same proof they FBI, CIA, NSA had on Congress with the DC Madame, and what ever they did. He had not connected the dots, but it is the same time span as the records he had of the spying on Trump for years they paid him to do, along with many others in the sweeps so no one would know who they were targeting.

"Gun-Free UK: Man Shot in Head by Bicycle-Riding Assassin   A man was shot dead by a gunman on a pedal bike in broad daylight in Liverpool, England, on Sunday morning.  Armed police officers and paramedics attempted to treat the 27-year-old victim for “critical injuries to the head and torso” at the scene, but he was pronounced dead not long after being taken to hospital, according to a police statement.   Detectives currently believe the killing was “targeted” and have released a description of the suspected assassin — who remains at large — as being “in his late 20s, white, of medium build, dressed all in black, and wearing a high-vis orange jacket”.  “The investigation into this shocking incident is in its very early stages, and we are keen to speak to anyone who may have information which could help us establish the full circumstances and find those responsible,” commented Detective Chief Superintendent Natalie Perischine.   “We share the community’s shock that this could happen in a residential street in broad daylight late on a Sunday morning. I want to reassure the public that gun crime will not be tolerated on the streets of Merseyside at any time of day and that we will thoroughly investigate any information given to us so we can put anyone who carries guns on our streets behind bars,” she added.   “I appeal again to anyone who may have seen the incident itself, or someone making off on foot or on a pedal bike, to please get in touch.”   London Police Appeal For Information After Fourth Shooting in Two Days, Illegal Gun Factory...  Two men were arrested Tuesday night after a shooting near Rayners Lane station in London which saw two injured, with Britains' capital city seeing a total of four shooting incidents in just two days.    Gun crime has risen sharply in Britain in recent years, particularly in the diverse capital of London, led by Labour’s Sadiq Khan.   Firearms offences there have risen by 44 percent between 2014 and the year ending October 2017, according to a Greater London Authority report — which further noted that almost half of all shootings are related to gang activity.   This is despite Britain boasting some of the most draconian gun control legislation in the West, with no ordinary citizens beyond a small number of current and former armed forces, police, etc. personnel in Northern Ireland being allowed to carry firearms for personal protection.   Even carrying or possessing non-lethal articles for self-defence is generally illegal, with civilians completely banned from owning pepper spray and other non-lethal deterrents.

"More evidence that Trump's Judas goats have totally infiltrated the Democrats.    General Michael Hayden is a former CIA and NSA director.    He decided to be a smartass and take issue with Trump's factual tweet.    And then Hayden was genuinely shocked by the response. This former CIA and NSA director IS UNABLE TO READ THE PUBLIC MOOD. He is so obtuse and oblivious that he could not anticipate the rage that average Americans feel at being screwed by leftists.    Someone told Hayden to get in on the act.     ""Fight fire with fire! Go on Twitter and be snarky! This is what wins elections!""    Hayden is too STUPID to perceive what was said a long time ago:    Trump's supporters take him seriously but not literally, while Trump's opponents take him literally but not seriously. Trump has mastered social media. It's a VERY specialized skill.    Hayden HONESTLY thought that he could arrogantly tell Americans to sit down, shut up, and accept open borders and caravans of illegals. He is STUNNED that the American public is no longer enslaved by the elites.    This CLOWN is one of the many reasons that the US floundered for so long. He looks to others for advice.    The people he looks to for advice are CLANDESTINE TRUMP AGENTS. Trump hires TONS of spooks. Of all the people Michael Flynn put into place, only ONE had been photographed. All those people retained their TS/SCI (Top Secret / Sensitive Compartmented Information) security clearances after Flynn resigned.    I call them the Leak Killers. Although their names are open source, I never repeat them. THEY are the reason the Trump administration has not been crippled by intelligence leaks. The recent leaks are penny ante, and my guess is the leakers were set up.    George W. Bush and Obama suffered from leaks that blew massive intelligence operations. The leaks severely damaged our ability to fight terrorism.    Trump has suffered no such leaks. He and Flynn PLANNED THIS. The Leak Killers were hired, given their TS/SCI security clearances, and then put out of sight in the vast federal bureaucracy. They ruthlessly police the Intelligence Community, making sure that nobody spills the beans about the important stuff.    Michael Hayden is a buffoon who has no idea how Americans think and feel.

"Labour Rising Star Mohammed Pappu Accused of Spreading Anti-Israel Conspiracy Theories   Israel staged 9/11, the London bombings and the Paris terrorist attacks, according to social media posts attributed to a rising Labour party star who is personally endorsed by leader Jeremy Corbyn.  Mohammed Pappu, 26, a newly elected councillor in the London borough of Tower Hamlets, was praised by hard-left Jeremy Corbyn last month for his help to create a “fair, just and decent society.”   However, a report in the Times newspaper paints a different picture of Mr Pappu. The newspaper alleges he publicly shared messages over Facebook accusing Britain of attacking Syria “to install a Rothschild bank” as well as other posts claiming that Israel had staged 9/11, the London bombings and the Paris terrorist attacks.  Mr Pappu, an Uber driver, also reportedly uploaded a sermon in which he proclaimed The Smurfs and Hallowe’en were demonic and occult-related, therefore should be avoided by observant Muslim families to protect themselves from the burning “torment of Hell.”   He is backed by the pro-Corbyn Momentum activist group and won the vote to become the black and ethnic minority officer for London Young Labour in February.   In another controversial post over Facebook, he shared a photograph of President Assad of Syria and his wife, Asma, with an illustrative cartoon speech bubble: “Why does the West want to invade Syria?”   Assad responded: “To rob our oil, put in a puppet government and install a Rothschild bank!”   He resigned from all his council posts yesterday and apologised unreservedly after the Times confronted him about his digital trail across social media. He also referred himself to the authority’s standards procedure. The national Labour executive is understood to have suspended him pending an investigation.   Mr Pappu is a trustee and former chairman of Soul (Social Organisation for Unity and Leisure), a charity that organises sports activities for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. His Facebook account was intended to be read by children as he used it until at least 2016 for updates on timings, cancellations, kick-offs and training for teams as young as under-tens.   The charity has launched an immediate safeguarding review.   The revelations come just 24-hours after Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, said Mr Corbyn “is an anti-Semite who wants to return Britain to dark periods in history.”   Mr Corbyn has previously welcomed “friends” from Hezbollah and Hamas – Islamist terror groups sworn to the destruction of Israel – into parliament and recently admitted attending conferences with Hamas members and a wreath laying at the grave of an anti-Semitic terrorist.   Footage has also surfaced of him comparing the state of Israel to Nazi Germany – a commonly recognised example of anti-Semitism.    LINK",0.0,Gab + Reddit,benchmark,3

"TERROR as Leicester on LOCKDOWN after Armed Police DELIBERATELY mowed down by car!    Leicester city centre is on lockdown after an armed police officer was  “deliberately driven at”. He is currently in hospital with head injuries according to a senior police chief.    DCC Rob Nixon tweeted: “Day started 5.20 am when received a call about an armed officer being injured @USER Officer deliberately driven at & now in hospital with head injuries. Full-scale operation now running to locate those responsibly! #protecttheprotectors”   Leicestershire Road Policing Unit tweeted: “Just been made aware of a serious incident involving a @USER colleague & friend who was seriously injured overnight. I, along with everyone on the RPU wish you a speedy recovery mate. Thoughts are with you, your family & friends.”   Two roads in the city centre are on lockdown as police have been investigating the incident from 3 am this morning.   The Twitter account for Area Traffic Control in Leicester tweeted: “Morning in #Leicester Belvoir Street is closed due to a police incident between Stamford Street & Bowling Green Street. To get to Market Street & Welford Rd pedestrians and vehicles will have to use Granby St & Bishop St.”   There have also been reports of police activity in other parts of the city possibly in relation to the‘incident’. Leicester was rocked by a massive Explosion earlier this year which was initially thought of as a gas explosion but a massive manufacturing basement was uncovered. The media line is that it was producing ‘illegal alcohol’.   Opinion: Unity News Network is sickened by what appears to be a clear and deliberate attack against the U.K.’s Police force, we would like to send our best wishes to the officer who was attacked and wish him a speedy recovery, we would also like to send his family our best wishes in what must be an incredibly hard time for them. This is not only an attack on U.K. Law enforcement but the United Kingdom itself.    LINK",0.0,Gab + Reddit,benchmark,3

"I just realized what this is.    ""President Donald Trump suggested without evidence Thursday that Democrats or their allies are supporting a 'caravan' of Central American migrants who are traveling north aiming to enter the United States.""    LINK     This is Trump admitting that his Judas goats convinced the Democrats to organize another caravan.    The Mexican cops are standing down, doing nothing to turn back as many as 7000 people--mostly military aged males--marching toward the US border. From what the invaders and their supporters are saying, it's clear that they think that if Trump takes action to stop them, it will will backfire politically on him.    Remember that Obama's former CIA and NSA chief Michael Hayden chimed in, telling us that we must submit to being invaded. We also have professional political activists telling us that sending the invaders back would be a crime against humanity.    So Trump is telling us that his Judas goats got the Democrats to commit another act of political suicide by funding a caravan so close to the midterms.    ""The leaks are real; the news is fake.""    That was trump telling the press to their faces what he was doing. And nobody understood.    These caravans ENRAGE Americans. What infuriates us is the video of them tearing down fences and telling us that they are entitled to come here illegally and take our money.    As insane as it seems, the Democrats are still unaware that Trump was elected in part to stop illegals from invading. So stopping the latest caravan will HELP Trump, not hurt him.    And Trump just told us that his Judas goats made this happen.",0.0,Gab + Reddit,benchmark,3

(We know more about Thomas Jefferson's bastard children than we do about Obama, Michelle, OR their two faked kids.) Try finding their birth certificates....From his Inaugural address, he slandered America, and within days had begun to encourage dissension of the races, as well as slandering police who he claimed acted stupidly. That was mild to the crap that would come in doubling the National debt from what had been built by ALL THE PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS PREVIOUSLY COMBINED, feeding us bullshit about how Muslims built this country, and nationalizing American industries. Fueled by George Soros money, and using the Air Force fleet as his personal vacation charters, he appointed malcontents and traitors into positions of authority. He trashed the Constitution by installing Czars including at least one communist (interesting he chose a title like that) to bypass Congressional authority. By that time, Congress was completely corrupt on both sides of the aisle anyway, and no one had the balls to impeach the charlatan, Obama!  Mysteriously, the lone-outspoken-conservative-Supreme Court Justice, Scalia, suddenly dies in his sleep at an Obama pals hunting lodge, and the Supreme Court is evenly split. Finally, Congress shows some balls, and rejects Obama's Supreme Court Justice nomination. The Libertards aren't worried because the fix is in.... Soros ""has paid"" demonstrators to cause turmoil at ""all the Republican gatherings"". Obama concedes that illegal aliens should vote because they won't be prosecuted, and Soros-manufactured voting machines are caught switching votes in certain precincts.  Hillary has cheated her way to the nomination, and her lies are completely ignored by the brainwashed minions of sycophants who follow her.  But a shocking thing happened on the way to the forum...  Middle America had had enough, and although the pollsters and the pipers tried to convince middle America not to even go to the polls to vote, the people were fed up with the denizens of the swamp. It was time. Florida was designated a swing state ignoring that all those old retirees living in St. Petersburg, and the fed up Cuban Americans of Miami weren't interested in their platform. Ohio and Pennsylvania, (where coal production was blacklisted, and where Obama had ridiculed them for clinging to their Bibles and their guns), lay waiting for this supposed landslide Hillary vote... and creamed it.  The Socialist world of the Democratic Party began climbing out from under the rocks and began following ""Bernie Free Stuff"", who'd spent his honeymoon in Moscow.  But, an American who expressed unbridled love of country and respect for police, firemen, and military, steamrolled across the heartland, and the liberals realized their scheme was trashed. A CONSTITUTIONALIST would be named to the Supreme Court, and if that old hag, Ginsburg, (who'd claimed to retire if Trump were elected) would actually retire and leave, the Supreme Court would have a massive majority of CONSTITUTIONALISTS for the next 40-50 years.  .

What's the appropriate amount of worry though? Do we think immigrants are going to tank the economy? Because, taking U.S. illegal immigrants as a model- they add economic growth. Despite working for low wages, they use their paychecks to buy things (which support about 8 million jobs in the U.S.) Even if the paychecks are welfare from the government- that money goes right back into the economy.

"I'm confused by this post. For starters - Kaitlin Bennett isn't ""hot""? She's an attractive skinny white blond woman who spends her internet time trying to get people to shit on shooting survivors. I guess ""hot"" means looking like idiot mean girl Tomi Lahren?

All of these people style themselves based on high school mean girls and Ann Coulter.

  They're all minions of disgusting right wing mouth breathers who secretly wish we lived in ""Handmaid's Tale"" Gilead, rape was legal, and it would probably be legal to murder ugly women or women and little girls who protested rape with impunity.

She **does** deserve it. No offense OP - but the woman you're posting is right on target, if what she's saying is true.  Fuck Kaitlin Bennett. I enjoy when misogynistic women reap what they sow. You think they're allies? They're not. They're not worth spilling tears for either. And I'm saying this as someone that finds the left as creepy, looksist, and secretly often as misogynistic as the right, so long the selected target is white (maybe Asian), cisgender - shit, even a lot of their attacks on men frequently strike me as fucked up and underwritten by ulterior motives totally divorced from any real, sustainable concept of justice, logic, or interpersonal accountability. Caitlin Jenner - who spent her pre-transition life as a right-wing jock with no interest in problems for women or sexual minorities and apparently has the same politics now, theoretically at her own detriment (but not literally of course - she's rich) - being lauded as a heroine is proof of that, frankly.

I'm just sort of at a loss as to how Kaitlin Bennett isn't ""hot"" but I don't give a shit if misogynistic women reap what they sow. Fuck right, they deserve it. They're agents of the men who want to put their favorite hookers in cabinet positions (Berlusconi), make rape legal, illegalize any medication or health procedure women need to participate in society as equals/control their own reproduction, and create a right wing theocracy. 

No sympathy.

Also - whoever this LivPosting is, she's not actually a hot chick or any ""hotter"" than Bennett; she strikes me as an average looking woman calling out a blond bimbo wannabe for supporting an ideology that leaves ""not hot"" chicks out in the cold, so...I dunno, what is the point of this post again? 

This woman isn't justifying looksism, she's pointing out the consequences of hypocrisy and being felled when you charge for misogyny and misogynistic ideology while female. Do you not see that? Are you offended because of your politics (in which case, I guess I should apologize for speaking so frankly) and the apparent anti-woman mindset of this Liv Posting? 

Are you really caping for hateful anti-feminists like Kaitlin Bennett, who are even less sympathetic to femcels and ugly women than even shitty corporate ""liberal"" feminists who are as focused on virtue signalling for a paycheck as anything else (like our wonderful friends at Mel Magazine, who have such contempt for the women here they'd lift their posts without asking) and have no empathy for real women if they have a self-serving goal in mind? 

The whole point of these posts is that Kaitlin Bennett supports a misogynistic society where looksism and sexism used against women is embraced. She's a (horrible, hateful, stupid, famewhore) woman without a country.

I'm sorry if you're conservative and that's why you're irked here.


Right and left - be it vocal, performative antifeminism voiced by babes of Fox primetime, Tomi Lahren, Meghan McCain, and Bennett; or highly visible corporatized ""feminist"" values presented by shitty faux-""woke"" startups that are revealed to treat their employees like garbage/shitty ""content"" spewing blogs like Mel, at al are mostly predicated on two things, two gods they worship in kind - self-serving engagement numbers, and money. So they support quashing labor laws and fair wages and fair medical leave and HRs that actually treat sexual harassment seriously and, in Bennett's case, try to jumpstart a career by inciting people to wish murder on high schoolers that watched their friends die, wearing AKs as accessories. On top of whatever right wing woman-hating horseshit she's promoting while hustling for a speaking engagement on the neocon airwaves.

Those antifeminists are the ultimate pickmes and only support feminism (for themselves, primarily, and perhaps women exactly like them) to justify...anti-feminism. To justify pushing the overturning of Roe v Wade. To justify ""my choice is a feminist choice because I have a vagina! (There's no such thing as marital rape! Let's murder gay people and burn witches again! Rah rah rah! Let me show you my tits!)""-style feminism, from their seats of influence, their soap boxes and promotional events. 

They're all united with one idea in mind - so long as I get mine (get my abortion, my featured piece, my seed funding, can roast other women alive for deserving to be harassed/raped, can use a shitty hashtag phonily presenting any incident where a woman is victimized, polarizing men and woman in the aftermath or something like a high profile revelation of a sex crime) - fuck everyone else. Fuck facts. I want the spotlight.

"Boyfriend [30M] is accusing me [29F] of riding the cock carouselThis is a throwaway account since my boyfriend knows my main Reddit account and I dont want him stumbling upon this post

To give some info, I [29F] have been with my boyfriend [30M] in the relationship phase for around 5 months now. We were in the dating phase for around 3 months before he asked me if I was interested in becoming a couple (relationship). I was initially surprised since I felt it was a bit soon for me, but I did (do) like him a lot and thought why not give it a shot and see what happens.

I feel that our chemistry has been very similar to the dating phase to the relationship phase, other than the fact we are dealing with lockdowns right now (like most people around the world). I like him a lot! I really do. But, I have noticed over the last month or so of talking with me, he brings up a lot of interesting topics around me. Last weekend when we were together, we ended up having this conversation where he was saying; *You were riding the cock carousel before you met me.* - things like that.

I did figure out in the dating phase that he liked the YouTuber, Entrepreneurs in Cars, since we talked about a couple of videos that Rich Cooper posted (he likes him). One of the reasons I like my boyfriend a lot is because I feel we can talk about pretty much anything and have good discussions. Im always trying to be the feminine addition to his life and compliment him on his journey. However, I dont like him accusing me of things like riding the cock carousel, or even when he mentioned me possibly monkey branching on him for another guy.

The last few times these comments have come up, it has bothered me quite a bit because I like him a ton. I dont like him accusing me of things that are not true (i.e. I havent rode the CC). Im looking for advice on how to approach this topic if/when it comes up again. For some reason, I feel like it will come up again at a later date and I would like to shut it down completely.

After making him dinner (again), we got into a heated argument on the gender wage gap. He doesn't get that (despite being illegal), female counterparts are paid (on average, counterparts meaning those colleagues in identical roles) less than their male counterparts. And now I am starting to doubt myself...

Yes, women have historically taken on lesser-paying professional roles, which is what my partner was arguing. I get that. But from what I've learned, it goes beyond that. If anyone could help me to find the evidence to support this, that would be much appreciated (info pertaining to wage gap between male/female employee counterparts, and yes I am aware of the difference that negotiating salary makes during initial hire and re-evaluating periods).

"Thats a good question, I suppose I might be conflating sympathy with giving people second chances. I assume that most feminists are likely in favor of giving criminals a chance to rehabilitate themselves and reform their lives for the betterment of society including people who commit sex crimes. In my mind, though, its hard not to feel like the two cant coexist: like if we dont have some amount of sympathy for these people then they may never feel compelled to improve. I may be totally wrong though. 

As for other comparable crimes I meant like people who killed another person by accident, or trafficked illegal drugs. Obviously killing people is wrong and depending on where the drugs came from they may have been indirectly supporting other crimes such as human trafficking. I suppose its easier to feel sympathy for these people because either didnt mean to hurt someone else or they didnt directly commit a crime against another person, though logically I know that these crimes arent any less bad than sex crimes.",0.0,Reddit,online-misogyny,2-3

"The old school mafia/yakuza sort of organizations were killed off, because they were collectively a threat to the rising power of the organized crime syndicate that infiltrated and took over politics. 

Singularly, a mafia family or yakuza gang was only really effective in their own burrow. They might have been a thorn in the side of a mayor or police chief. But even then, they largely kept things in-house and had somewhat of a code of ""no innocents"" or at least, no touching those within their own communities. 

Then, as more of these organizations formed, they started getting more powerful. Forming alliances, making enemies of each other. 

Then drugs became a huge part of it, and a lot of the rules went out the window. 

Sometime during the 60s and 70s, when the drugs were rampant within those underworld gangs, they basically were at odds with gov entities, kind of like what we see now in places like mexico where they have cartel problems. Their power wasn't really equal, but it was enough to be a threat. 

Where those people held as much sway or perhaps coercion over their communities as any gov entity did. 

It was pretty well documented that they could even sway elections, and that goes back even into the early days. 

If a bunch of mafia dudes showed up to collect their protection money, and ""reminded"" you that your business, and all of your employees needed to vote for a certain candidate.... That probably meant that if that candidate lost, there would be repercussions. So those businesses needed to coerce their employees, their unions, etc., through whatever means, to vote a certain way. 

Well.... once they become at odds with the politicians as a whole, they have lose their usefulness in that regard, which is why they basically went extinct. 

I mean, sure... There are still shady organized crime rings, but it's mostly cartel linked stuff now. Nothing like the mafia/yakuza stuff from back in the day. All of that stuff more or less dissipated. 

They all either went to prison, died off, or went into politics. 

The same families, the same money, the same old power structures still exist somewhat... They just don't have the same ways of doing business. Now they just operate through political business dealings, big donors, and fundraisers. 

The ""protection money"" rackets are less about sending thugs to a sandwich shop with baseball bats to collect money, assuring them that nobody will bust their windows out... But more about sending a limo with political campaign lawyers to a boardroom to assure corporate interests that votes against a certain regulation are going to go a certain way so long as the campaign gets into office... At which point donations are made to the campaign. 

Really.... You can think about the organized crime world like an organism with life cycles. The 20th century romanticized version of mobsters running around all Tony Soprano was basically the coming of age, angsty teenager stage. 

It matured in the 90s and 2000s and morphed into the adult stage that we have now.",0.0,Reddit,online-misogyny,2-3

Then when he runs again in 2024, he will be ready to go through with mass arrests and we'll all be able to watch live televised executions all day long.

Trump is simply pulling a 9 dimensional level play here. I will spell it out for you: He wants to lose. He pretends he doesn't. He legally rigged the election against himself. The democrats are fooled. He forces them to show their hand once more. Traitor republicans blow their cover and flip early. Everyone not fully committed to Trump outs themselves. The deep state continues its demonic activity out in the open. He comes back and wins the 2024 election. It's all over for the deep state.

Rest assured. The military will patrol the streets, there will be executions. It just wont happen when we expect it. 9D Chess here",0.0,Parler,Parler,3

[linebreak]  [linebreak] The question was along the lines of ""There is a serious problem with illegal immigration in the US.""  The expected answer was that this was opinion, not fact. However, there undeniably IS a serious problem with illegal immigration in the US. No matter where you fall in immigration, whether it be open borders or no immigration or somewhere in between, we fundamentally do not agree to a solution in the US. Thus it is a serious problem.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Now I understand that the stance one can take on the problem of illegal immigration in the US is varied and subjective, but the existence and degree of the problem is pretty objective.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The issue I have with this is because Pew is authoritative and the research by Pew is often used in partisan arguments.

"The IOM, now the NAS, was tasked with finding research to see if vaccines did or did not cause a long list (increased over time) of conditions, including autism. Their conclusion was that, for the vast majority, you could not determine so because the quality and scope of the research available was of such poor quality and scant amount. They have repeatedly over the several decades returned the same conclusion to cdc and given recommendations for improvement, which have been repeatedly ignored. The last report was from 2011.  As always, the incredibly alarming results are concluded with, 'but continue to vaccinate.'  Which makes no sense.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] You can get lost in the weeds with the number of poor studies that say autism is not linked to vaccines, but looking at the methodology quickly exposes how these results were contrived.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] > This Washington Post-ABC News poll was conducted by telephone August 16-20, 2017 among a random national sample of 1,014 adults, including users of both conventional and cellular phones. The results from the full survey have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Sampling, data collection and tabulation by SSRS of Glen Mills, Pa. [linebreak]  [linebreak] This is what I had read initially and had thought all 1014 answered each question, I hadn't seen the specific vote counts. That's my mistake, though I don't think an n of that size necessarily renders a poll worthless, and I still stand by my view that ""nobody supports them except those in the group"" is an exaggeration, and a potentially dangerous one at that.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I also want to point out that the concern isn't so much the people that some people may currently support neonazism or white supremacy, it's those who aren't necessarily in that world but are susceptible to brainwashing and propaganda. Before probably the late 90s/early 2000s you had to join a group to be radicalized. Not the case anymore. It's the same MO that ISIS uses — find young men who are somehow emotionally susceptible to propaganda; maybe they hold a lot of anger in, maybe they are (understandably) sad and resentful that they can't find someone to date, maybe they have some unresolved trauma... and they find an ideology that for some reason is an outlet for that — it gives you something to express your anger and emotions at (even if it may not be wholly logical but someone can convince you it is). You don't have to meet up with people to be a white supremacist. You don't have to indicate it to anyone outwardly. As long as you don't express it in public, and you contain it to your online persona, nobody really ever has to know. But that doesn't mean you're not a white supremacist. It's still infected your mind and poisoned your thoughts. And you do, quietly, support those whose actions support the lies you've been deceived by.

We go out in public together (gasp), I work from home doing my relatively high-income software PMO director job where I have a few dozen white employees in my department, I own my condo and car, I went to the gun range last week for some practice with the firearms I *own*, I went to law school, and I voted in November. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But yeah it's *super* racist in the South. Basically just like the civil war. You know, the civil war in the 1860s when I was considered property *owned* by someone, couldn't vote, looking at a white woman would've been grounds for the general community to kill me to say nothing of sleeping with one on a regular basis, owning property would've been *hilariously* challenging, and for me to be in possession of a firearm would've been (again) grounds to probably kill me.

"Recently, some scandals involving Seungri (member of Big Bang) and his club The Burning Sun exposed a lot of stuff.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] In addition to this, private messages from a chat group got leaked that involved multiple high profile people in the music industry chatting and talking about actually going out and raping girls (directly using the korean word for rape) and one was sharing secret videos of his sexcapades (which is a WHOLE other issue in Korea since they ban real porn sites so people share illegally filmed spy camera porn and such) including prefacing some of them saying that he was only filming because she was passed out because he knew she would say no. One of the girls involved is in Twice. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So with this, everything associated with Seungri and the others is fairly barren.

"A Response from Microsoft to ImJustaBagofHammers [linebreak]  [linebreak] > Let's talk about ImJustaBagofHammers's complaints. Let's talk about them in a very specific and personal way. Here's the story: ImJustaBagofHammers sees itself as a postmodern equivalent of Marx's proletariat, revolutionizing the world by wresting it from its oppressors (viz., those who increase awareness and understanding of our similarities and differences). For some odd reason, ImJustaBagofHammers believes that laws are meant to be broken. Its unasinous aides-de-camp, who believe likewise, also fail to see that the feudalism ""debate"" is not a debate. It is a harangue, a politically motivated, brilliantly publicized, irrational attack on progressive ideas. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > ImJustaBagofHammers wonders why everyone hates it. Apparently, it never stopped to think that maybe it's because it's easy enough to hate it any day of the week on general principles. But now I'll tell you about some very specific things that it is up to, things that ought to make a real ImJustaBagofHammers-hater out of you. First off, I'm not asking whether its verbalisms are valid or whether they have any application to current topics of theoretical and political importance. I'm asking only the following specific question: Is it possible for those who defend morally questionable imperialism to make their defense look more raffish than it currently is? This isn't such an easy question to answer, but let me take a stab at it: ImJustaBagofHammers's soliloquies have kept us separated for too long from the love, contributions, and challenges of our brothers and sisters in this wonderful adventure we share together—life! I would inarguably not have thought it possible that ImJustaBagofHammers gained ascendancy through monstrous abuse of its foot soldiers, but it's true. How did ImJustaBagofHammers get so yellow-bellied? I have my theories, but they're only speculation. At any rate, an understanding of the damage that may be caused by its swinish rejoinders isn't something I expect everyone to develop the first time they hear about it. That's why I write over and over again and from so many different angles about how ImJustaBagofHammers has stated that its ruses epitomize wholesome family entertainment. I find such declaratory statements quite telling. They tell me that I'm no psychiatrist. Still, from the little I know about psychiatry I can undeniably say that ImJustaBagofHammers seems to exhibit many of the symptoms of Asperger's syndrome. I don't say that to judge but merely to put ImJustaBagofHammers's rebarbative philosophies into perspective. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > The sad truth is that our nation is infected with the poisons of nepotism, stoicism, and xenophobia. And the sadder truth is that those poisons have been fed, watered, fertilized, and fostered by ImJustaBagofHammers and its claque. On that note, let me say that I defy the insolent, petty ogres who ridicule the accomplishments of generations of great men and women, and I defy the powers of darkness that they represent. ImJustaBagofHammers exhibits signs of arrested development, don't you think? What I'm trying to say is that ImJustaBagofHammers's rummy, brown-nosing ideologies are meticulously designed to keep the population unaware, uneducated, dumbed down, and focused on stupefying activities like video games. The intention is to prevent people from noticing that ImJustaBagofHammers has been funding, assembling, and training alabandical whiners to shove us towards an absolute state of vassalage. Some people have said that ImJustaBagofHammers's record of truth-telling is, shall we say, less than a hundred percent. Maybe. But I'm more inclined to believe that I unequivocally dislike ImJustaBagofHammers. Likes or dislikes, however, are irrelevant to observed facts, such as that ImJustaBagofHammers has the nerve to call those of us who follow through on the critical work that has already begun ""conspiracy theorists"". No, we're ""conspiracy revealers"" because we reveal that ImJustaBagofHammers has quite a clever technique for concealing its intent to make us the helpless puppets of our demographic labels. Specifically, its technique is to delve into philological discussions about comparative abstractive norms whenever the conversation veers too close towards revealing that its vassals have repeatedly been caught making people suspicious of those who speak the truth. I had expected better from ImJustaBagofHammers and its vaunted loony-bin crew, but then again, it keeps trying to expose and neutralize its detractors rather than sit at the same table and negotiate. And if we don't remain eternally vigilant, it will honestly succeed. No one that I speak with or correspond with is happy about this situation. Of course, I don't speak or correspond with repulsive criminal masterminds, ImJustaBagofHammers's confederates, or anyone else who fails to realize that knowledge is the key that unlocks the shackles of bondage. That's why it's important for you to know that ImJustaBagofHammers must be surrounded by some sort of reality-distortion field. Why else would its encomiasts claim that it is forward-looking, open-minded, and creative? If it weren't for all that reality distortion they'd instead be observing that ImJustaBagofHammers's tricks have merged with frotteurism in several interesting ways. Both spring from the same kind of reality-denying mentality. Both condone universal oppression. And both hijack our educational system and turn it into a self-cloning propaganda machine. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > I recently heard some encouraging news. It appears that ImJustaBagofHammers's ongoing campaign to create a new cottage industry around its vindictive form of desperadoism has been meeting some opposition. Apparently, not everyone wants ImJustaBagofHammers to undermine the intellectual purpose of higher education. Rather, an increasing number of people have come to realize that it seems to have recently added the word ""hyperphosphorescence"" to its otherwise simplistic vocabulary. I suppose ImJustaBagofHammers intends to use big words like that to obscure the fact that the very genesis of its moonstruck biases is in Bonapartism. And it seems to me to be a neat bit of historic justice that ImJustaBagofHammers will eventually itself be destroyed by Bonapartism. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > Although unbiased journalism died long ago, I'm pleased to find at least some minimal reporting of how I, unlike ImJustaBagofHammers, refuse to beat plowshares into swords. That represents yet more evidence—as if we needed more—that I shall not argue that ImJustaBagofHammers's newsgroup postings are an authentic map of its plan to expose and punish individuals who do not conform to its philosophies or beliefs. Read them and see for yourself. Out of the vast number of devastating evils for which hypocritical gomerals are directly or indirectly responsible, I shall pick out only a single one which is most in keeping with the inner essence of ImJustaBagofHammers's politically incorrect, ultra-putrid canards: paternalism. I am indeed annoyed with ImJustaBagofHammers's insistence that views not informed by radical critique implicitly promote hegemonic values. Sorry, ImJustaBagofHammers, but that's not a fact. That's intellectual dishonesty bordering on lunacy. If ImJustaBagofHammers wanted to speak the truth, it should have said that a recent United Nations report on human-rights abuses found that it acts with animus against those who expurgate sectarianism in all its forms from our humble community. The devastating findings of this report should not be ignored. In particular, I want to highlight the report's observation that ImJustaBagofHammers finds it convenient to blame all of society's woes on deplorable undesirables. Doing so fits with the rest of its populist sloganeering and takes less intellectual effort than investigating the structural factors and material practices that may in fact be the true reason that just as night follows day, ImJustaBagofHammers will mold your mind and have you see the world not as it is but as it wants you to see it before you know it.
